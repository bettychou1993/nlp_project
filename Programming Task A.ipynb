Absolutely love that there\\'s a \\'notes\\' section and a place to take notes for each single oil, blend, type of use/application & for every symptom/illness.  This app is super user friendly, the Vita Flex charts are a wonderful reference to have at my fingertips & the search bar for anything under the \\'Guide\\' section is fabulously useful.   I have shown this app to several other people who have decided to spend the $7-8 (whatever it costs, I forget since I\\'ve had it so long) on it because it\\'s so much easier than flipping thru a super thick book to find the info that is just a few clicks away in this app.   I had chest pains from anxiety and almost went into the hospital because of it. I looked up heart/chest pains in the guide and found Ylang Ylang and Aroma Life as a suggestion to diffuse or breathe in directly from the bottle. I tried it and within minutes my chest pain was gone and I was calm and relaxed.  I tried this out on a few friends who were having anxiety attacks and crying from mental breakdowns and it had the same effect on them. Within a few minutes their eyes were clear and they were smiling again.  I have, without even trying to do so, made a few non-believers actually begin to believe in the power of essential oils and aroma therapy bc of the help listed in this app!  Absolutely recommend 100%! Especially if you use Young Living essential oils, as many of the blends are Young Living\\'s own and you may not find them from other companies.   Hands down the best essential oil reference guide app I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of using! Thank you so much!   An update with some of the new oils would be wonderful, but I swear I\\'ve used this app enough to pay off that small charge for this app over a hundred times at least!   Easy Five Stars!    \\\\u00f0\\\\u009f\\\\u008c\\\\u009f\\\\u00f0\\\\u009f\\\\u008c\\\\u009f\\\\u00f0\\\\u009f\\\\u008c\\\\u009f\\\\u00f0\\\\u009f\\\\u008c\\\\u009f\\\\u00f0\\\\u009f\\\\u008c\\\\u009f   Full Review   \"}, {\"rating\": \"100\", \"review-text\": \"  Please update and add the new oils to it.

Are your kids hyperactive when playing with the tablet before bed time?\\nAre you using your smart phone or tablet in the late evening? Twilight may be a solution for you!\\nWARNING: Android O does no allow the app to cover your notifications and lockscreen anymore. We have some workarounds like wallpaper filtering etc..\\nRecent research suggests that exposure to blue light before sleep may distort your natural (circadian) rhythm and cause inability to fall asleep.\\nThe cause is the photoreceptor in your eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range which may suppress Melatonin production - a hormone responsible for your healthy sleep-wake cycles.\\nIn experimental scientific studies it has been shown an average person reading on a tablet or smart phone for a couple of hours before bed time may find their sleep delayed by about an hour.\\nThe Twilight app makes your device screen adapt to the time of the day. It filters the blue spectrum on your phone or tablet after sunset and protects your eyes with a soft and pleasant red filter. The filter intensity is smoothly adjusted to the sun cycle based on your local sunset and sunrise times.\\nPRO features\\n- more than 2 predefined profiles\\n- adjustable transition time\\n- option to turn off Twilight service altogether during inactive times\\n- new features will often first appear as PRO\\nThank you very much for your intention to support our development.

Full Review   \"}, {\"rating\": \"100\", \"review-text\": \"  This is my go-to app for every ache, pain, ailment, sickness or mood swing under the sun.  Absolutely love that there\\'s a \\'notes\\' section and a place to take notes for each single oil, blend, type of use/application & for every symptom/illness.  This app is super user friendly, the Vita Flex charts are a wonderful reference to have at my fingertips & the search bar for anything under the \\'Guide\\' section is fabulously useful.   I have shown this app to several other people who have decided to spend the $7-8 (whatever it costs, I forget since I\\'ve had it so long) on it because it\\'s so much easier than flipping thru a super thick book to find the info that is just a few clicks away in this app.   I had chest pains from anxiety and almost went into the hospital because of it. I looked up heart/chest pains in the guide and found Ylang Ylang and Aroma Life as a suggestion to diffuse or breathe in directly from the bottle. I tried it and within minutes my chest pain was gone and I was calm and relaxed.  I tried this out on a few friends who were having anxiety attacks and crying from mental breakdowns and it had the same effect on them. Within a few minutes their eyes were clear and they were smiling again.  I have, without even trying to do so, made a few non-believers actually begin to believe in the power of essential oils and aroma therapy bc of the help listed in this app!  Absolutely recommend 100%! Especially if you use Young Living essential oils, as many of the blends are Young Living\\'s own and you may not find them from other companies.   Hands down the best essential oil reference guide app I\\'ve ever had the pleasure of using! Thank you so much!   An update with some of the new oils would be wonderful, but I swear I\\'ve used this app enough to pay off that small charge for this app over a hundred times at least!
