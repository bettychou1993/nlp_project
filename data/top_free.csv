PROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU
Facing obstacles alone can be daunting – receiving support and guidance from a professional counselor has been shown to make huge, positive changes to help you overcome personal challenges. When you sign up we’ll match you to an available counselor who fits your objectives, preferences and the type of issues you’re dealing with. Different counselors have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you.
LICENSED AND TRAINED COUNSELORS & THERAPISTS
There are over 750 counselors in BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 2,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced and accredited psychologists (PhD/PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional counselors (LPC), or similar credentials.
All of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective field. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board are completing the necessary education, exams, training and practice.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
You and your counselor will get your own secure “room”. This will be your private place to communicate day or night, 24/7. You can access this room from any internet connected device, wherever you are.
You can write about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions and discuss the challenges you’re facing. Your counselor will login to the same room and respond with feedback, insights and guidance.
Together you’ll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals and overcoming your troubles.
HOW MANY SESSIONS CAN I HAVE?
You aren’t limited to a certain number of messages (“sessions”). The frequency of your sessions depends on your availability and the interaction between you and your counselor. You may prefer to have 3-4 short interactions per week, or 1 very long and thorough session. You can use the service as much or as little as you like, depending on your needs. Your therapist will work to accommodate your changing needs in a timely manner.
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?
Many people avoid getting professional help because it can become extremely expensive. We want to make BetterHelp easy and accessible to everyone, so we've created a plan which is simple, predictable, risk-free, and affordable.
Plans range from as low as $35 per week. With any plan you choose, you will pay a fraction of the cost of traditional counseling.
If you accomplished your goals or if you found it to be no longer helpful for any reason, you can simply cancel the subscription. Canceling is easy and done online - there are no hoops to jump through.

This app is for those who have 'little problems' I believe.

The financial aid I got helped a bit but still didn't help to make it feel worth it. I really like the idea of this app but there's significant improvements that could be made.

com.bodbot.trainer,BodBot Personal Trainer: Workout & Fitness Coach,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"500,000+",4.6,"BodBot is a true digital personal trainer, creating workouts tailored to your goals, resources, physical abilities, desired difficulty and much more. Each workout is tailored down to the level of the individual exercises, and the plans adapt over time as you complete or miss sessions.
Just as a good personal trainer will personalize your workout plan, we create an individual program for you and adapt it as you progress. Limited range of motion in the shoulders? We can work to correct that. Weaker in the back than in the chest? We can address that. Hamstrings too tight? Want to develop the biceps or the glutes? Can only workout in a few windows during the week? BodBot can handle it all, and your workouts will reflect all of these needs. We're committed to providing you with the best possible training plan and the very best workouts. More than this, if you miss a workout, or if you decide to go hiking on a whim, we can integrate this new information and update your training plan accordingly. The plan lives and breathes with you and for you.
So what distinguishes a modern, science-based, intimately personalized training system? What does BodBot do - and why does this matter?
■ Personalization matters. If you broke your leg this morning, you probably shouldn’t be attempting heavy squats at night. Similarly, if your sleep has cratered for the past week, or if you suddenly come down with a fever, the previous trajectory of your fitness - along with last week’s view of this week’s best training plan - becomes obsolete. You need a recommendation that reflects your new circumstances.
■ While changes are rarely this dramatic, a missed workout, an unexpected hike, a bout of insomnia or any of life’s other curveballs should not derail you from your training plan or your goals. BodBot can and will handle these changes.
■ People naturally progress at different speeds. Rather than breaking yourself on the yoke of a program that’s either too slow or too fast - too inefficient or wildly risky - it is possible to respond to your rate of progress and adapt the training to reflect your own unique work capacity. BodBot will work with you to set the best pace and rate of progression. By contrast, most apps today either use absolutely no system of progression, or static fixed percentage increments.
■ Everyone has a different history: variations in posture, strength, cardiovascular fitness, range of motion, joint stability, joint mobility and much more. These variations matter. Rather than overloading a weak and unstable joint or hammering an already shortened and tight muscle, BodBot will work with you to improve performance and increase efficiency - through targeted fitness tests and objective assessments. This is not the hand-waving personalization of other fitness apps. This is modern, high quality physiology and kinesiology realized in intelligent training recommendations.
■ Accessibility matters - if you’re working out at home you should still be able to get a high-quality, targeted workout - not an arbitrary infinite loop of burpees, wall-squats and crunches. BodBot’s database of broad and deep exercise profiles, together with the sophisticated algorithms that run over the top of them, seamlessly handle changes in location and equipment. Similarly, schedules can run tight and can change - if your default Monday, Wednesday, Friday pattern is interrupted, or you suddenly have less time available than expected, BodBot will immediately adjust your training plan.
■ Specificity matters - beating about the knees with a tire iron will certainly provoke soreness and perhaps even work up a sweat - but it will not generate favorable improvements in performance (assuming self-assault does not become the new fad) or body composition and certainly not wellness. It’s the type of stimulus, not the magnitude of pain, that dictates results - BodBot will use each and every drop of sweat to help you achieve the results you want.","[{""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  I did have to look up a few exercises just to make sure my form was correct.

It is great how you can choose the type of workout (what length of time, workout level eg beginner, music and voice commands you want). The one thing I would love to see on there is a function so you can eliminate certain poses that aren't suitable for an individual and also a function where you can put together your own workout from a list of poses. That, I would absolutely pay for! Having rods in my spine prevents any backbends such as camel pose etc and they are other people out there having the same issues so I am sure it would be great to be able to remove these from the workout. I have suggested the app to a few people but some of them are beginners and have hip and other problems, so being able to customise would allow these people to get your app. The other huge advantage this would have is if you get an injury you can customise your workout around it.

It has many options for creating custom sessions that work offline after being saved. The photos are fine & use less data than video. I liked Down Dog so much I bought a pro subscription so I could use 'boost' & other options. I'm holding back a star because: (1) The quoted hype about 'always-changing' & 'randomized' sequences is misleading. The algorithm generates a predictable sequence for each combination of settings. (2) My saved sessions are listed in chronological order. It would help A LOT if I could sort/filter by name, type, length, etc. (3) The app uses a lot of storage; please add the option to move it to the SD card. (4) The app doesn't promptly log all of my completed sessions. (5) The app would be more user friendly if it had a user guide & more details in the online FAQ.

In general, this is a very helpful app. When syncing and tracking steps, it's great! Food logging is more tedious than other apps, but still makes it nice to put calories in and calories out on the same app. Since the last update on 9/19/18, tracking a walk now requires the screen stays on the entire time. So if you're on battery saver mode and the screen turns off, it stops tracking your exercise and starts again only when you turn the screen on again. It used to work well.

In the end, you are the one who needs to lose the weight, and make sure things you don't want to eat don't pass your lips. This app, however, can hold you accountable and help you see what you have done in the day. I love it and will continue to use it. I have lost 4 pounds in just a few days because I chose to put in the work. This app is just meant to be a reminder and an estimated number for your progress.

Even if it isnt correct down to the atom, I appreciate it can tell me my numbers and statistics. I also like that it can estimate a day that goals will be reached, as that can give me a good understanding of how long I will be in this for. Recommend 100%.

Haven't. Even. Eaten. Yet. And I'm not getting the weekly weight reminders anymore. The hydration counter is also horribly inaccurate - under-logs my intake by half or more some days.

Get the free version if you want a calorie log but don't waste your money or time with the paid one. If I didn't have a vast offline data pool after using this app for years I'd drop it. Update: I wish I could give NO stars. Added a new exercise regimen to my life: barre. Guess how many calories this app says I burned in 1 hour? ZERO. Really?? Where do they get their data? And you can't edit erroneous exercise data like you can food data. Update - the stupid, condescending pop ups have been reduced a good deal, to the point I too the plunge on the lifetime premium version and now the app is PAINFULLY slow and crashes several times a day; it usually takes me longer to record my lunch than eat it and I am a fairly slow eater!

com.google.android.apps.fitness,Google Fit: Health and Activity Tracking,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"10,000,000+",3.8,"Get to a healthier and more active life with the new Google Fit!
It's hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That's why Google Fit worked with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you two new activity goals that can help improve your health: Move Minutes and Heart Points
• Move Minutes
When it comes to your health, it's important to move more and sit less. Earn Move Minutes for all of your activity and get motivated to make small, healthier changes throughout your day, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, or catching up with a friend over a walk instead of a coffee.
• Heart Points
Activities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity, like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30 minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity, which is shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental well-being.
Google Fit will also help you:
TRACK YOUR WORKOUTS FROM YOUR PHONE OR WATCH
Get instant insights when you exercise and see real-time stats for your runs, walks, and bike rides. Fit will use your Android phone's sensors or Wear OS by Google smartwatch's heart rate sensors to record your speed, pace, route, and more.
MONITOR YOUR GOALS
See your daily progress for Heart Points and Move Minutes. Meeting your goals each day? Based on your activity and goal progress, Google Fit will help you adjust them so you can keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.
MAKE ALL YOUR MOVEMENT COUNT
If you walk, run, or bike during the day, your Android phone or Wear OS by Google smartwatch will automatically detect and add your activities to your Google Fit journal to ensure you get credit for every move. Enjoy a different type of workout? Select it from a list of activities like pilates, rowing, or spinning, and Google Fit will track all the Heart Points and Move Minutes you earn.
GET COACHING THAT FITS YOU
Get customized tips and actionable coaching, like help adjusting your goals based on your activity
CONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES
Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices to give you a holistic view of your health, so you'll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Wear OS by Google, Nike+, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Lifesum, Basis, Sleep as Android, Withings, Xiaomi Mi bands, and more.

Now... Cold, Sterile, minimalist user input, highly inaccurate tracking (30 bike ride and it had me clocking a trip if 327 miles). The addition of The American Heart Association is the ONLY positive feedback i can give on this butchered version of the Original Google Fit App. Hey Development team, Try making an app that's for the user and not those your collecting our data for who purchase it for their gain... Looking more and more like Facebook guys...   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  Need alot of work. Can't stop recording fitness clearly and easily, lacks average speed and elevation, can't open app after an activity to zoom in where exactly you rode. Not good at all.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  They fixed the freezing and crashing, but as someone who is very active, this app does so little.

Doesn't count the step properly. Very basic and nothing exciting in this app now. Revert it back to old functionality, Google !   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""20"", ""review-text"": ""  This version of the app consistently logs subway rides as walks.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  Used to be very helpful app. Now it just got so complicated with non-user friendly interface.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""20"", ""review-text"": ""  Is anyone reading these reviews? Literally nobody likes the new version. It was perfectly fine as it was, but you reinvented the wheel with loads of features nobody wants and got rid of the features we've all been using for years.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  Seems to be missing the widget for phone home screen now, those of us not using a watch found that useful.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  This app is inaccurate (steps counter) and has gross inconsistencies on distances. For example, it correctly tracked my 13k steps and initially told me I walked 5.5 miles (roughly accurate). An hour later I have more steps and the distance shows a total of .47 miles. I restarted my phone and force stopped the app, and it says the same. The app gives you no option to give feedback to Google whatsoever, so they can't/won't help debug it.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""20"", ""review-text"": ""  Past version captured steps, this one doesn't. It reports meaningless stats like heart points and move minutes.

The new version is not useful for setting goals and keep track of daily activities. Hopefully you can make it better soon. I'm currently looking for a better app, similar to the old Fit.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""60"", ""review-text"": ""  This app was 4 stars until the latest update yesterday. Now my step counts are all reduced (to very inaccurate counts!). Before the only reason it wasn't 5stars was due to slow speed to update counts.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""60"", ""review-text"": ""  Good idea, but currently the app often miscalculates the number of heart points etc. Says I have finished my goal, and when I open the detailed list and sum up the points everything checks out, but the circular display on the start page shows completely different values. Very annoying!   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""20"", ""review-text"": ""  Since the last update the ux is horrible. It doesn't track as it should, it says I haven't moved any minutes but then I did 15K steps. I have it connected to my smart watch and it doesn't show.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  This used to be my go to fitness tracking app for general day to day tracking of walking/running. I particularly liked the widget I could have on my home screen to see quickly how many km I had walked so far but this feature has been removed.

Tired of checking in at the end of the day to see 0 steps, 0 minutes, and I have no idea why because my 'backup' tracking app shows my THOUSANDS of sreps that day! Frustrating and annoying, I'm switching to something reliable.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""20"", ""review-text"": ""  Terrible app. So difficult to get an accurate step count, the app seems to refresh at random intervals. I miss the widget feature the most. So difficult to maintain a consistent exercise pace while punching in phone unlock code and then having to select the app from my list of apps. App was so much better before the unnecessary updates   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  I really loved the old Google fit. The recent update eliminated many of the useful features I liked. (i.e. doesn't call out pace anymore on runs, can't modify a tracked run for time or distance if the logging is wrong). The new features like heart and move minutes are useless. Don't like the new version at all. Time to go back to the drawing board Google. You screwed up a great app.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  It looks better than the old UI. It's better at filtering off nonhuman movements. But overall, it's unstable and unpolished. Some data entries would not delete. Some have no option to. It often crashes when doing active tracking, which causes it to track continuously in the background until the hard stop at the end of the day.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""20"", ""review-text"": ""  I'm really unhappy with the latest update. I found it really useful to track active time and calories each day and to be able to customise my own weekly goals for specific activities (e.g. rowing machine, strength training). The new update has broken my weekly goals, which no longer display correctly and won't allow me to add new ones. I do not find heart points a useful metric. I am looking for a new alternative that won't just reduce all activity down to gamified heart points. I also miss the widget that stayed on my home screen and actually helped motivate me. Random notifications about how I've earned a week's worth of 'heart points' by walking to work are just confusing and not motivational.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""60"", ""review-text"": ""  There's a small problem. When I travel in the bus it detects the swaying motion as me on the move and gives me heart points for that. This feels like cheating to me. Please correct this if you can   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  Old app worked well enough. When this new app came out it seemed great with more features than the old one but now it's just going crazy. I just realized it totally wiped out all of my steps for 8 days (I mean it's showing zero steps for an entire week). Note that the steps were there 3 days ago... I'm hoping that it is fixed and my steps reinstated because I track my weekly and monthly activity and this messes everything up. I'm definitely installing a back up app.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""60"", ""review-text"": ""  Good concept & nice interface. But a few bugs like counting my daily metro commute as a run & awarding heart points & move minutes for it. (I travel standing in a metro train for approx 2.5 kms each way)   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  Even when I'm still trying to get used to the new look, I love this app. O would really like a feature where you can calculate burn calories per exercise and it would be great to add Housekeeping and Intimacy as exercises.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  Recent update killed off the great watch face so not happy. Using this paired with Huawei Smartwatch 2. I like the simplification of the app as the specific activity goals I set previously I was terrible at keeping. As someone who casually exercises, the Move &Heart points are simple enough goals to try and achieve daily.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""20"", ""review-text"": ""  Highly inaccurate in measuring and retaining distance. Will capture the number of kilometers walked and then automatically deducts kilometers. Please bring back the old version. How does Google approves crappy updates? Are quality checks not happening anymore at Google?   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""20"", ""review-text"": ""  I have used this app for years with no problems now after all of these new upgrades.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  Doesn't seem to be accurate with my steps, & seems to do very little.. Only downloaded because my other app, Runtastic asked me to download it to sync with it, otherwise I'd not have bothered.. There's better free step counter apps out there..

I use the free version. The recipe creation feature is particularly useful. As are the goal setting, day meal diary, macro breakdown, weight tracking and adjustment for calories burnt exercising. It has a few areas that could be improved though, particularly the search feature which often doesn't sort results well. For example, it doesn't preference generic versions of things like apples, meat, eggs, etc over specific brands of these which can be irritating. Overall, quite good and I'd recommend.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  It used to be 5 star, but now it's much less. The app is not compatible with Samsung Gearfit devices. The steps counts are grossly inflated and the calorie counts show negative adjustments of 390 calories on every workout day, no matter what the activity is. So it is impossible to track any nutrition. I have been emailing support for over 3 months and have received replies that 'sometimes some updates take longer than others.'

There is one thing I would like changed though - integrate a Food database with the barcode scanner separately, where all food items can be added and stored for adding daily food searches (like when i go to the stores and add all food choices via the scanner) . At this stage, adding food can only be done within the daily food list.

It's an amazing app and no other app that I have tried comes close. It has many resources, recipes, challenges & helpful articles. The most underutilized part is the social media aspect. The profile, friends list, posts and wall are less than desirable but I don't mind because I use this app for my personal needs/goals and I don't need another Facebook or Instagram.

Even though I haven'tbused the app in years, it still has all my login info and welcomed me back. This is a good 'self serve' type of app. If you need more guidance like what to eat and when to eat it, you may want to try something else. If you have a pretty good idea of what you are doing and just need an accountability measure, then this app is great!

No way to turn off my fitness pal blog spam on my homepage even though I do not find it useful and it just gets in the way of my seeing my friends activity. Often slows down and crashes for no apparent reason. Often copies Foods at random and I have to delete the duplicates later. Abuses inordinate amounts of data even when I'm not using it so I have turned off background data and urge others to do the same. Also uses CPU in background for no apparent reason, I recommend killing the app when you are not actively using it to avoid whatever it is doing in the background (draining your battery, downloading ads, perhaps even spying on you.)

com.northcube.sleepcycle,Sleep Cycle alarm clock,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"1,000,000+",4.5,"Sleep Cycle introduces sound analysis - sleep tracking with no need to place the device in bed.
WAKING UP MADE EASY
Sleep Cycle is an intelligent alarm clock that tracks your sleep patterns and wakes you up in light sleep - the natural way to wake up, feeling rested and energised.
HOW IT WORKS
As you sleep, you go through different sleep phases, ranging from light to deep sleep and back again. The sleep phase you are in when your alarm goes off is critical for how tired or rested you will feel when you wake up.
While you sleep, your movements vary depending on what sleep phase you are in. Sleep Cycle’s patented technology tracks your sleep patterns using sound or vibration analysis, monitoring your movements in bed throughout the different sleep phases.
Sleep Cycle finds the optimal time when you are in light sleep to wake you up in the morning, during a predefined 30 minute time window that ends at your set alarm time. Waking up in the lightest sleep phase feels like waking up naturally without an alarm, leaving you feeling rested and energized.
All you need to do is turn Sleep Cycle on before going to bed, and place your device on your nightstand or close by on the floor.

Disclaimer: Period Tracker period and fertility forecasts may not be accurate and should not be used to prevent unwanted pregnancy.  To forecast ovulation Period Tracker calculates 14 days before the projected start date of one's next period.  Forecast accuracy depends on a number of factors including how regular one's cycle length is, when one actually ovulates during the cycle, and how many periods have been logged in the app.  Anxiety, stress, diet, nutrition, exercise, environment, medications, age and other factors can also affect one's cycle from month to month.

com.repsi.heartrate,Heart Rate Monitor,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"1,000,000+",4.5,"Heart rate or heartbeat is an important measure in health and fitness. Using Accurate Heart Rate Monitor app, you can now measure and monitor your heart rate!
★ Incredibly accurate in measuring your heartbeat
★ Free with unlimited recording
★ Easy to use with intuitive design
★ Identifies heart rate training zones (Rest, Fat burn, Cardio, and Peak)
★ Google Fit support
★ Estimates calorie burnt per hour
★ No additional hardware required
How to use the heart rate monitor free app to measure your heartbeat?
To use this heartbeat counter, just put your finger on the phone's camera and stay still, the heart rate is shown after few seconds. Covering a part of flash may help heartbeat counter to become even more accurate.
What is a normal heart rate or heartbeat?
According to Mayo Clinic, a normal resting heart beat rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute (BPM). However, keep in mind that many factors can influence the heart rate, including Activity level, Fitness level,  Body size, Emotion, etc. Generally, a lower heartbeat at rest implies more efficient heart function and better cardiovascular fitness.
Consult your doctor if your resting heartbeat is consistently above 100 beats per minute or if you're not a trained athlete and your resting heartbeat is below 60 beats a minute
What are heart rate training zones?
Heart rate training zones are calculated using maximum heart Rate (MaxHR). Within each training zone, subtle physiological effects take place to enhance your fitness. We have a similar definition to those used in Fitbit trackers:
- REST ZONE (up to 50% HRmax): This considers as resting zone.
- FAT BURN ZONE (50 to 70% of maximum): Recovery and warming up exercises should be completed in this zone. It’s called the fat burn zone because a higher percentage of calories are burnt from fat.
- CARDIO ZONE (70% to 85% of HRmax): Most of the main exercise should be completed in this zone.
- PEAK ZONE (greater than 85% of HRmax): This zone is ideal for short intense sessions (high-intensity interval training HIIT) to improve performance and speed.
This heart rate monitor app calculates and automatically saves your heart rate training zones.

OVERVIEW
SleepIQ® uses intelligent biometrics to provide a daily score based upon your personal goals and sleep patterns.
Sleep: See last night’s metrics, including SleepIQ® score, SLEEP NUMBER® setting, biometrics, and sleep times at a glance. A summary statement provides context to what your metrics mean.
If you’d like to remove a night from your view, “Remove Sleep Session” allows a sleeper to remove a night and its associated data.

Insights: Insights puts your SleepIQ® score in context, giving you the chance to see how activities and inputs (like coffee or exercise) affect your sleep. It allows you to see your sleep in comparison to your partner, other people in your age range and gender (“Like Me”) and other people who live in your area (“Near Me”), both in monthly and historical views (the length of time you’ve been using SleepIQ).
Bed Controls: SleepIQ® makes controlling your SLEEP NUMBER® bed simple – no remote necessary. Use the guided experience to find your SLEEP NUMBER® setting  Choose a position preset for your FlexFit™ adjustable base, or use the up/down arrows to make adjustments. Control items like Underbed Light from Accessories, and easily access Routines
Routines: Edit routines and add routines for different nights of the week, so you can adjust your sleep to your individual schedule. Note: If you get into bed before your stated bedtime, Routines will not work.

This app has been a life-changer for me and I am so thankful! *Update 4/12/17: Oftentimes, I choose the guided meditation based on how much time I have available, and I use the guidance as my 'interval bells.' Without an ending bell, I peek at the clock, see that the period has ended, and break my meditation with abruptness and urgency, wondering how much longer I sat than I anticipated.

I'm still not sure what the rest of this life has in store for me - or what I have stored up to give to it - but I feel so much more peace about the possibility and the unknown! I have relied on the guided meditation for much of the year and aim to increase use of the self-timer - to be able to 'find my center' without daily guidance.

Strava depends on GPS for recording activities. In some devices, the GPS does not work properly and Strava will not record effectively. If your Strava recordings show poor location estimation behavior, please try to update the operating system to the most recent version. There are some devices which have consistently poor performance with no known remedies. On these devices, we restrict installation of Strava, for example the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 and the Galaxy Express 2.

com.tmsoft.whitenoise.lite,White Noise Lite,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"1,000,000+",4.4,"AS SEEN IN CONSUMER REPORTS!  Find out why the world is sleeping better with White Noise Free.  Features ambient sounds of the environment that will help you relax during the day and sleep great at night.
Do you have trouble going to sleep?  Are you traveling on a plane and need a quick power nap?  Does your newborn baby wake up in the middle of the night?  There are numerous benefits to using White Noise:
•	Helps you sleep by blocking distractions
•	Relaxes and reduces stress
•	Pacifies fussy and crying babies
•	Increases focus while enhancing privacy
•	Soothes headaches and migraines
•	Masks tinnitus (ringing of the ears)
Even when you’re asleep, your brain is constantly scanning and listening for sounds. If it’s too quiet, unwanted noises such as faucet drips or police sirens can interrupt your sleep. White Noise generates sounds over a wide range of frequencies, masking those noise interruptions, so you can not only fall asleep, but stay asleep.
SOUND CATALOG
40 sounds are included as part of the application (no downloading required unless you want more) including all the color noises (brown, white, pink, etc), mechanical sounds like a bedroom fan or air conditioner, light to heavy rains, rushing water sounds, beach and ocean waves, and so much more.  For the entire list of sounds please visit our website.  No streaming is required for playback.

•  Full screen digital clock with multiple colors and brightness controls makes it the perfect companion for any nightstand

WHAT IS THE KETO DIET?
The keto diet (also known as a ketogenic diet, low carb diet and LCHF diet) is a low carbohydrate, high-fat diet. Maintaining a low carb diet is great for weight loss. Moreover, according to an increasing number of studies, a low carb diet helps reduce risk factors for diabetes, heart diseases, stroke, Alzheimer’s, epilepsy, and more!
WHY REDUCE CARBS?
We’re beginning to understand that carbs in large quantities are more harmful than previously thought, while most fats are healthy & essential (the basis of a low carb diet).
When you eat lots of carbs, your blood sugar is consistently elevated and, as a result, so is insulin. Insulin is a hormone that keeps your blood sugar in check by shuttling the glucose into cells, but when there’s a consistently high amount of insulin, your cells become resistant.
This insulin resistance makes it easier to store fat, and chronically high levels of insulin also cause excessive inflammation in the body, which contributes to heart disease, high blood pressure and eventually type 2 diabetes.
A keto diet can reverse these harmful effects & restores insulin sensitivity.
THE KETO DIET IS STARTING A NUTRITION REVOLUTION!
The nutritional landscape is changing. The keto diet (low carb diet) is growing in acceptance and a nutritional revolution is beginning. We are starting to realize the detrimental effects of our relationship with excess sugar & carbs.
The keto diet focuses on low carb recipes to keep your blood sugar stable, helping your body regain insulin sensitivity and keeping your mood & energy levels stable.
When you’re on a ketogenic diet, you can expect to:
• Lose body fat
• Have consistent energy levels during the day
• Stay satiated after meals longer, with less snacking and overeating
HUNDREDS OF LOW CARB DIET & KETO RECIPES!
Keto recipes make you feel better, live better and eat better. Each low carb recipe is delicious – we know because we only share the ones we love.
We’ve included hundreds of low carb recipes for you to choose from. The main goal of these low carb recipes is to:
• Keep carbs low – under 25g a day, ideally
• Increase your protein intake – aim for at least 60g a day
• Keep you full and satiated from delicious meals

• What is the Keto Diet?

com.urbandroid.lux,Twilight: Blue light filter,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"5,000,000+",4.6,"Are you having trouble falling asleep? Are your kids hyperactive when playing with the tablet before bed time?
Are you using your smart phone or tablet in the late evening? Twilight may be a solution for you!
WARNING: Android O does no allow the app to cover your notifications any more..
Recent research suggests that exposure to blue light before sleep may distort your natural (circadian) rhythm and cause inability to fall asleep.
The cause is the photoreceptor in your eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range which may suppress Melatonin production - a hormone responsible for your healthy sleep-wake cycles.
In experimental scientific studies it has been shown an average person reading on a tablet or smart phone for a couple of hours before bed time may find their sleep delayed by about an hour.
The Twilight app makes your device screen adapt to the time of the day. It filters the flux of blue light emitted by your phone or tablet after sunset and protects your eyes with a soft and pleasant red filter. The filter intensity is smoothly adjusted to the sun cycle based on your local sunset and sunrise times.

1) Bed reading: Twilight is more pleasant on the eyes for night reading. Especially as it is able to lower the screen backlight far below the ability of the backligt controls on your screen
2) AMOLED screens: We have tested Twilight on an AMOLED screen for 2.5 years without any sign of depletion or over-burning. If properly configured Twilight causes less light emission (by enabling dimming) with more equal light distribution (dark areas of the screen such as the status bar get tinted). This may in fact increase your AMOLED screen life time.

SECURITY
You must always sign in with your User Name and Password. No one but you can reach your personal data.
And once a year we need you to confirm your profile. If your app says it's time to update, log in to the secure site using your computer or mobile web. After you confirm, you can once again access your secure, personal info ― from your computer, Aetna mobile, and this app.
TROUBLESHOOTING
Can't access all the app's features?
If you have more than one Aetna plan or program, the app will prompt you to choose one. Choose your main account. This includes the claims of your current plan. (Some people have Aetna plans from previous jobs; those accounts show only old claims. Other people have financial accounts, such as a health savings account. This is not a main account.)
Is the health plan under your name? (Meaning you are the subscriber or primary account holder.) If so, you can access all the features your plan allows. If you are a dependent, you will have limited access, just like you do when using the secure site on a computer or via mobile web.

There were great lags (4+ days)between responses and there is no number you can call to get issues figured out in a more timely manner.

** FEATURES **
HOW BIG IS BABY
The Bump is the original home of the cute fruit :)
Prepare to smile and look forward to each week: The Bump compares your baby’s growth in utero to beautifully illustrated fruit (“Baby Is As Big As a Peach”) that’ll delight you and make you excited to share with friends and family.
Plus, find comprehensive updates about the changes and developments happening to both your baby and body, and learn how best to prepare for them.
DAILY CONTENT
Everyday, the award-winning editorial staff of The Bump delivers fresh and relevant content for the specific week of your pregnancy. The articles are timely and extensive: always know what’s safe and normal; find out how to ward off morning sickness; learn the best things to pack in your hospital bag; and discover how fellow moms are embracing pregnancy and motherhood.
REAL ANSWERS
Exclusive to The Bump: The ability to ask questions and get quick answers from three different sources (1) The Bump editorial staff (2) The Bump team of experts, including leading doctors from One Medical, Maven Network and Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York (3) moms like you.
REGISTRY
The Bump is the #1 Baby Registry destination in the US, hosting over 1 million registries every year! The Bump has become #1 by solving two of Baby Registry’s biggest challenges:
+ The Bump has collected over 15,000 of the top registry products across Babies “R” Us, Target, Amazon, buy buy Baby and Walmart, WITH REVIEWS for most of the products. This will quickly grow to over 100,000 products so you can find everything you want and need for your Registry.
+ The typical mom-to-be will register at two stores because there are always some special items that require a special, secondary registry. The Bump has you covered! The Bump will AUTOMATICALLY track all your registries across each retailer so you can keep tabs on what you’ve registered for, what’s been purchased and what still remains.
BELLY AND BABY PHOTOS
Document your pregnancy by creating a weekly album of your happily growing belly. And once baby is born, the album expands to track the first amazing year of baby’s life.
CUSTOMER SERVICE
The Bump team reads every email (and responds to almost all of them personally), answers each phone call and takes to heart all of your reviews. And unlike other pregnancy and baby apps, you’ll never have to pay for this service. This is your pregnancy. This is your baby. This is your app. Have a problem, don’t hesitate to let us know.

I may accidentally hit something and  exit out of the app unintentionally, or my phone may freeze/reboot  unexpectedly, and I'll have to start all over with the workout so things  like my time or proper calories burned, etc., aren't accurately recorded.  So it would be great to have a way to actually save your progress  mid-workout ib case anything happens so that you can pick it back up later.  It would also be nice if some workouts and such were actually stored within  the app other than needing data or wi-fi to connect and access things (some  24 hour fitness locations have random deadspots around the gym that make it  impossible to update or progress in your workout mid-session.

I like the sounds and I really enjoy being able to make your own combos of sounds. But to get most features that are normal features in most apps, you have to pay a good bit of money a year.

The only way to stop this is to either restart the phone, or go into apps and notifications and 'force stop' Relax Melodies. Then, it shows 0% usage. This is fairly recent (last two months or so), and even after the September 17 update this morning I still show it using a gigantic chunk of battery, even though it's not running.
