Not everybody can do sit ups, bench presses, weight lifting, etc. Thankfully, with the help of Team Pink, there is now a way to work out via a simple, easy to perform, 3 step exercise programme. These routines are designed to allow people who can't stand up for long or may have difficulty with full body workouts such as the elderly. You can work at your own pace, and in your armchair (or kitchen chair, we don't mind).
Even if you can do full body workouts, there may be times where you're stuck at an office desk, or on a long plane journey, these videos allow you to get your triceps and biceps warmed up. You can comfortably work out and keep your body healthy and fit no matter where you are.
This app gives you a preview of the routine video created by Team Pink, which was helped made possible by sponsors and partners like Comic Relief, The National Lottery, Community Voice and the People and Work Unit.
As a bonus for showing an interest in the app, we have provided a video that shows what led to the idea of the exercise programme, and how it can help get more people to get some exercise done.

So, what makes this root so good for us?
In one word: Gingerol.
Of the 115 different chemical components found in ginger root, the therapeutic benefits come from gingerols, the oily resin from the root that acts as a highly potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent.

Similar to meditation, this anti stress coloring app allows you to switch off your brain from other thoughts and focus on the moment, thereby helping to remove free-floating anxiety.
Since coloring involves the use of both creativity and logic, the analytical side as well as the creative side of your brain are activated when coloring.
Stress relief games and coloring games like this app, spark your creativity. Coloring makes adults more creative in their job, analytical thinking activities, and various realms of work and play.
This colour therapy game trains the mind to concentrate better, relax and reset. Research shows that coloring can help adults attain academic and career success, and encourage them to deliver innovative work performance.
Colouring is also a great way to exercise your fine motor skills.
Filling colors in the images of the app removes your focus from negative habits and issues, and lets you focus in a productive and safe way.
In case you face any issues regarding the app, please visit http://stressreliefcoloring.bluedreamapps.com/
The ‚Äúprescription‚Äù of coloring for adults originated from the great psychologist Carl Jung, who considered coloring to be highly effective and helpful for human mind. Ben Michaelis, a clinical psychologist, says that coloring is a peaceful activity, which creates relaxing effects on the amygdala ‚Äì the brain's fear center. Filling colors in coloring books for adults lets your mind receive the rest it requires.
Stress Relief Adult Color Book can provide you the relaxation and peace you have always longed for. Experience calmness, tranquility, and enhance your emotional and mental well-being by making coloring a part of your day-to-day life.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  Overall, a great app. I wish that the meal plan suggestions for the day would vary more without having to go into each meal and choosing something appropriate, there are days, for example, where almost all of the suggested meals are shakes, seems like there could be a way that the app suggested a more balanced variety. Also, sometimes when doing the workouts the counter for the rest period will count up rather than down so you have to watch it to see when the specific amount of time has elapsed rather than have the audio cues which exist when it is working properly. An option to track calories and the actual meals consumed would be helpful as well. Overall, this app is a great tool to add to a fitness toolbox.

It spells out ev-ry-thing for you to do :) Plus, through the app you can be connected to a supportive community of fellow 'Transformers'. If I could change things, they would be (1) ability to put in actual meals & snacks (for better or worse) to have an accurate record of intake, and (2) if a workout is skipped, be able to show a record of making it up. [I have a suspicion that these aren't current features because the program is intended to be completed as they've set it up; but, these updates would be nice both for accuracy/integrity, and if you need to problem solve any lack of progress.]   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  The Transform App really is ingenious. i wonder about whoever designed it because they did a brilliant job in trying to incorporate all we need to start taking control of our health and our lives.

It‚Äôs referred to as many different names ‚Äì ketogenic diet, low carb diet, low carb high fat (LCHF), etc. its an effective way to lose weight fast.
When you eat something high in carbs, your body will produce glucose and insulin.
Glucose is the easiest molecule for your body to convert and use as energy so that it will be chosen over any other energy source.
Insulin is produced to process the glucose in your bloodstream by taking it around the body.
Since the glucose is being used as a primary energy, your fats are not needed and are therefore stored. Typically on a normal, higher carbohydrate diet, the body will use glucose as the main form of energy. By lowering the intake of carbs, the body is induced into a state known as ketosis.
keto diet recipes is a natural process the body initiates to help us survive when food intake is low. During this state, we produce ketones, which are produced from the breakdown of fats in the liver.
The end goal of a properly maintained keto diet recipes is to force your body into this metabolic state. We don‚Äôt do this through starvation of calories but starvation of carbohydrates.
Our bodies are incredibly adaptive to what you put into it ‚Äì when you overload it with fats and take away carbohydrates, it will begin to burn ketones as the primary energy source. Optimal ketone levels offer many health, weight loss, physical and mental performance benefits.

The Weight Watchers Beyond the Scale Program, launched in late 2015, is designed to help people eat better, move more and shift their mindset.
The program assigns every food and beverage a SmartPoints value, based on its nutrition (higher amounts of saturated fat and sugar increase the point value; higher amounts of protein bring the point value down).
Choices that fill you up the longest ‚Äúcost‚Äù the least, and nutritionally dense foods cost less than empty calories. So if you‚Äôre wavering between a cup of lobster bisque soup or a chicken salad sandwich ‚Äì both 380 calories ‚Äì the sandwich is the smarter choice.
A backbone of the plan is multi-model access (via in-person meetings, online chat or phone) to   support from people who lost weight using Weight Watchers, kept it off and have been trained in behavioral weight management techniques.
With Beyond the Scale, Weight Watchers members lost 15 percent more weight in their first two months following the new program, the company says, compared with those who           followed the previous program.

com.dsi.ant.plugins.antplus,ANT+ Plugins Service,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"100,000,000+",3.3,"This service is similar to the system components that enable other forms of wireless connectivity on your phone (ie. WiFi, NFC) and will not run or use system resources unless you start an app that requires ANT wireless communication. It is pre-installed by your device manufacturer to allow the built-in ANT wireless hardware already present in your mobile device to operate. If you do not intend to use this feature there will be no impact to your system and no further action is required.
If this service is not pre-installed on your phone you may still be able to enable ANT+ communication, see  http://www.thisisant.com/developer/ant/ant-in-android/ for more info.
The ANT+ Plugins enable other apps to communicate with millions of ANT+ wireless enabled devices. These other applications which utilize the plugins will allow you to do things such as collect, transfer, and view your sport, health, and fitness data in real time. New apps, devices, and profiles are continually being developed, with endless opportunity for personal monitoring and other low-power communication applications.
The current version of the plugins supports the following ANT+ profiles:
-
Bike Power
: Receive power data from ANT+ cycling power meters. Includes seamless support for all power meter types and the new advanced data sent from meters such as the Garmin Vector
-
Audio, Video, and Generic Controls profiles
: Send and Receive control data with remote controls (IE: use a remote control watch app to control your MP3 player or camera)
-
Heart Rate
: Receive live heart rate data from heart rate straps produced by many popular manufacturers
-
ANTFS Watch downloader utility
: Download saved activities from ANTFS enabled watches
-
Bike Speed and Cadence
: Receive live bike speed, distance, and/or cadence data
-
Blood Pressure
: Download saved measurement data from blood pressure devices
-
Stride-based Speed and Distance Monitor
: Receive live speed and distance data from footpods
-
Fitness Equipment
: Connect to ANT+ enabled fitness equipment to receive live workout data
-
Geocache
: Search for and receive/send data with remote devices such as the Garmin Chirp
-
Weight Scale
: Read and download weight data and advanced body measurements such as BMI from ANT+ enabled weight scales
-
Environment
: Receive temperature data and records from remote temperature sensors such as the Garmin Tempe
Attention Developers!
Using the ANT+ plugins in your app to communicate with ANT+ devices is quick, easy, and free and uses a simplified API that doesn't require referencing technical documents or learning new protocols. Visit the ANT Android Developer page http://www.thisisant.com/developer/ant/ant-in-android/ for more info and to download the SDK.
Note
: This application is a service that other applications use to communicate with ANT+ devices. It can not be launched directly. List of certified applications: http://www.thisisant.com/directory/filter/~/115/~/
Also note
: This service requires the ANT Radio Service to be installed and requires hardware support built into your phone or via an adapter. Please refer to the ANT Radio Service listing for more info and hardware requirements  (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dsi.ant.service.socket) or http://www.thisisant.com/consumer/ant-101/ant-in-phones/
ANT+ is an established wireless technology with over 60 million devices in the market.

com.finalsurge.runtracker,Final Surge,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"10,000+",4.1,"Final Surge¬Æ is the coach, team, club, and athlete training platform that won Triathlete magazine's 2018 Face Off for Best Online Training Log. Always free to athletes, Final Surge empowers athletes and coaches to reach fitness and performance excellence like never before.
The Daily View shows basic workout data, plus whether the workout status is planned or completed. If completed, the workout is color-coded to indicate whether the workout was completed as planned. If the workout was not completed as planned, color-coding indicates whether the workout was simply missed‚Ä¶ or was under, or over, performed.
In the Daily View, tap on the Quick Complete button to easily enter workout data, including just one-tap on the Complete As Planned button to automatically enter Distance, Duration, and Pace for the workout, plus you can easily add How You Felt, your Perceived Effort, and Workout Notes. These features make manual entry easy, but of course, the App automatically syncs workouts from sports watches and other devices through Garmin Connect¬Æ, Strava¬Æ, and more.
The Quick View button puts the most important workout information only one tap away, which can be especially nice when you have several workouts or are a coach working with several athletes.
The Quick Comment button opens a messaging-style screen where comments between coach and athlete for each workout are readily available.
Of course, if you are using a sports watch or similar tracking device and want to dive into every detail about this workout, just tap on the top of the workout to show the Details View. The Details View has the following 5 tabs; Planned Versus Completed, Laps (Splits), Workout Map, Workout Graphs, and Comments between Coach and Athlete for each workout.
The Final Surge App also has a Weekly View that doesn‚Äôt require you to awkwardly put your phone into a landscape position. An entire week of workouts is shown, and just like with the Daily View, workouts are color-coded to instantly show you the status of each workout. Tapping on any of the workouts in the Weekly View opens the same 5 Workout Details screens available for the Daily View.
Coaches can easily access a list of their Athletes and Teams with one tap, and review and manage their Athletes‚Äô Workout Calendars and Teams‚Äô Workout Calendars with the same detail as the Athlete‚Äôs Views. The App includes Push Notifications to notify of workout completions, workout comments and other vital real-time occurrences in training.
Team and Group calendars, internal message boards and individual messaging make this App ideal for high school, collegiate, professional and club teams. The App includes a Coach's Mailbox for direct private communication and private Social Walls that provide a complete social media experience to drive athlete motivation and engagement.
The App syncs with Garmin¬Æ Connect, Strava¬Æ, and other platforms to access all major sports watches and similar tracking devices and provides highly accurate geopositioning information, including corrected elevation.
The App supports the new running power tracking and advanced cycling power metrics, such as weighted power, max power, average power, and intensity.
The App also tracks your Vitals, information maintained about your weight, sleep, blood pressure, etc. to monitor your overall health and progress due to improved fitness. It also includes a workout History capability where you can review summary presentations of your past workouts.
You can track Workout Gear (bikes and shoes) and save your favorite workout Routes. Your own customized Workout Zones (HR and power) can be used to make sure you are always performing an optimized workout. The App can access leading Workout Calculators to always make sure you are working out at the right pace. Easily load Training Plans for virtually any kind of race from the world‚Äôs best coaches.

I think it would help a lot. Also it should have an option to lower  the music volume so you can hear the trainer better.

To forecast ovulation Period Tracker calculates 14 days before the projected start date of one's next period.  Forecast accuracy depends on a number of factors including how regular one's cycle length is, when one actually ovulates during the cycle, and how many periods have been logged in the app.  Anxiety, stress, diet, nutrition, exercise, environment, medications, age and other factors can also affect one's cycle from month to month.

com.racejoy.racejoy,RaceJoy (Race Joy),HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"100,000+",3.1,"RaceJoy is created specifically for running, cycling and triathlon events with a focus on the participant and spectator experience. Features vary by event and may include live phone tracking, progress alerts, results, race information, photos, Send-a-Cheer and much more!
There are three distinct experiences in RaceJoy:
-Timing Integration Events
-PhoneTrak Events
-Training Days
Timing Integration Events:
These are events that have contracted with RaceJoy to provide a premium experience for participants and spectators. Features are free and provided by the event or sponsor(s).
Features vary by race and may include:
-Tracking with Progress Alerts: There is no need to carry your phone as this is based on the participant‚Äôs BIB/chip as they cross over timing points on the course.
-Scored Race Results within moments of crossing the finish line.
-Automatic Progress Postings to Twitter (with your approval, of course!).
-Essential race information like schedules, FAQs, race news, BIB numbers, and more.
-Your official race photos and RunPix information.
-Optional PhoneTrak for live phone tracking and Send-a-Cheer!
PhoneTrak Events:
These are events that offer:
-Live GPS phone tracking on the actual course map.
-Send-a-Cheer! (fun motivational audio clips).
-Proximity alerts (spectators and waiting relay teams get an alert when a participant is drawing near).
-MeetUp tool for seeing where you are in relation to a participant.
-Optional Scored Race Results within moments of crossing the finish line and Photos based on event.
The race participants must carry their phone during the race to experience these features.
Training Days
This feature enables athletes to have their friends and family track their progress live on a map and send motivational cheers during long training runs or rides. All PhoneTrak features are available in Training Days, along with special motivational cheers to help you through those tough moments.
Add a Race?
If you would like a race to offer the full featured experience with official race progress alerts and results, please let the race director know about RaceJoy. If you would like to use the phone tracking for an upcoming race, send us your request at AddRace@racejoy.com.
Battery Usage
RaceJoy‚Äôs live phone tracking feature is ONLY activated during the hours of the event. When using Training Days, the athlete turns on/off tracking as needed. Use of this GPS technology running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. You may disable this under settings at anytime during the event to conserve battery life if needed.
Feedback and Support
We hope you enjoy using RaceJoy! Please share your experience in the App store to encourage others to try it out. If you have had any issues, or have feedback or ideas, please help us to improve the experience by contacting us at support@racejoy.com.

Discover SleepIQ¬Æ technology.
Only Available with Sleep Number¬Æ beds.
WHAT‚ÄôS NEW
Whether you want to get a higher SleepIQ score with more restful sleep, or longer time in bed, we know you count on SleepIQ to work smoothly. This release features improved Bluetooth connection to give you the best sleep experience with SleepIQ technology as well as other feature advancements and bug fixes.
NEW IN THIS RELEASE:
-	Ability to adjust FlexFit‚Ñ¢ adjustable bases and save favorite bed positions over the Cloud ‚Äì previously just available over Bluetooth (Bed Controls)
-	Visual representation of movements on FlexFit‚Ñ¢ adjustable bases to help you see where the bed will be set (Bed Controls)
OVERVIEW
SleepIQ¬Æ uses intelligent biometrics to provide a daily score based upon your personal goals and sleep patterns.
Sleep: See last night‚Äôs metrics, including SleepIQ¬Æ score, SLEEP NUMBER¬Æ setting, biometrics, and sleep times at a glance. A summary statement provides context to what your metrics mean.
If you‚Äôd like to remove a night from your view, ‚ÄúRemove Sleep Session‚Äù allows a sleeper to remove a night and its associated data. The data associated with that night is not included in averages or totals for a month, unless you choose to restore the session later. This allows for elimination of anomalies of exceptionally low or high scores that might impact your overall SleepIQ average.
Insights: Insights puts your SleepIQ¬Æ score in context, giving you the chance to see how activities and inputs (like coffee or exercise) affect your sleep. It allows you to see your sleep in comparison to your partner, other people in your age range and gender (‚ÄúLike Me‚Äù) and other people who live in your area (‚ÄúNear Me‚Äù), both in monthly and historical views (the length of time you‚Äôve been using SleepIQ).
Bed Controls: SleepIQ¬Æ makes controlling your SLEEP NUMBER¬Æ bed simple ‚Äì no remote necessary. Use the guided experience to find your SLEEP NUMBER¬Æ setting¬† Choose a position preset for your FlexFit‚Ñ¢ adjustable base, or use the up/down arrows to make adjustments. Control items like Underbed Light from Accessories, and easily access Routines
Routines: Edit routines and add routines for different nights of the week, so you can adjust your sleep to your individual schedule. Note: If you get into bed before your stated bedtime, Routines will not work.
Settings:
SleepIQ¬Æ also allows you to track delivery of your bed
Help is located under Sleeper Profile, and connects you to Customer Service, user guides and more
If you choose, SleepIQ¬Æ will connect with the following home, health and wellness apps:
-	Nest
-	Fitbit
-	MapMyRun
-	Nokia Health (Withings)
-	Microsoft Health
Feed: Feed offers expert articles about sleep, health and wellness. Additionally, helpful tutorials reside within Feed to help you make the most of your experience.
360 FEATURES
With a Sleep Number¬Æ 360 smart bed, take advantage of these features for effortless sleep.
-	‚ÄúGetting to Know 360‚Äù tutorial that walks you through how to use SleepIQ with your 360 smart bed
-	Set a timer to use Foot Warming from within SleepIQ¬Æ (360 FlexFit‚Ñ¢ 3 adjustable base only), or add to Routines for automatic usage
-	Adjust the intensity of Underbed Lighting to low / medium / high (360 FlexFit‚Ñ¢ 1/2/3 adjustable base only)
-	Responsive Air can be turned on and off in Bed Controls
-	‚ÄúFavorite‚Äù button on the side of the bed, which is controlled with SleepIQ¬Æ (360 FlexFit‚Ñ¢ 1/2/3 adjustable base)

Other notes
- There is no wristband or other hardware required, the pedometer app uses the sensors from your device to calculate everything! Just download, launch and enjoy!
- Our free pedometer can't be synced with other step counter apps like Fitbit, Pacer, Samsung Health, Starva, etc
- Some older devices don't have any step sensor; in such case we use an algorithm based on accelerometer sensors to estimate the steps count. You may find some discrepancies with other pedometer apps like Pacer or Samsung Health, but we believe our algorithm is fairly accurate. If not, please contact us :) Note that some very specific phones may not count steps at all...
- The rewards can only be obtained and used if you reside in the country where winwalk is officially distributed! Also rewards can be added or removed from the in-app shop and lottery at any time, just check it out regularly.
- the pedometer offers an optional lock screen function, so that you can check your steps and claim your coins easily.
- winwalk pedometer is totally free to use, but the app contains ads. E-gift cards are valuable and we have to eat as well :p
winwalk pedometer is released in selected countries where e-gifts are available, we will be releasing the app gradually in more countries in the future.

Fun Fact #1
What is ketogenic Diet or Keto Diet.
The ketogenic diet is a very¬†low-carb diet plan¬†that was originally designed in the 1920s for patients with¬†epilepsy¬†by researchers working at¬†Johns Hopkins Medical Center. Researchers found that fasting ‚Äî avoiding consumption of all foods for a brief period of time, including those that provide carbohydrates ‚Äî helped reduce the amount of seizures patients suffered, in addition to having other positive effects on body fat, blood sugar, cholesterol and hunger levels.
Fun Fact #2
What is Ketosis?
Ketosis¬†is the result of following the standard ketogenic diet, which is why it‚Äôs also sometimes called ‚Äúthe ketosis diet.‚Äù Ketosis takes place when glucose¬†from¬†carbohydrate foods¬†(like grains, all sources of sugar or fruit, for example) is drastically reduced, which forces the body to find an alternative fuel source: fat. Although dietary fat (especially¬†saturated fat) often gets a bad name, provoking fear of weight gain and heart disease, it‚Äôs also your body‚Äôs second preferred source of energy when carbohydrates are not easily accessible.

I can do nearly all of  the exercises without stepping into a gym. I love that I can customize the  timing to suit my needs. Before using this app, it was 'No, I'm too busy,  my schedule is always changing, I have more important things to do', etc. I  also love that there are low-impact and beginner, as well as advanced  workouts. The linked rewards system is a great motivator. I also love that  I can do my workouts without pity or judgment. Some workouts can only be  unlocked in the Premium version, but whether you have Premium or not, this  app is well worth it!   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  Very versatile app (premium version); it has many canned workouts and, as a beginner, it was easy to get started. You can also create your own workouts from a list of over 275 exercises. None of the exercises requires equipment, but you can use weights on many of them. Four instead of five stars because customizing exercises could be better. If you could set timing parameters for individual exercises it would be possible to create challenging but achievable workouts. Currently, timing parameters are the same for all exercises and workouts so if there is an exercise that is particularly had for you you either have to tough it out or remove it.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  Dear Developers, I've been a loyal member to your app ever since i saw you  guys on Shark Tank. Ever since then I've used your app nearly every week.  But now that your update is out, i can no longer workout since now it's  requiring me to upgrade to a better plan. Now I've considered switching  over since i cannot afford the premium plan. There is a bug where once you  tap on custom workout it forces you to buy premium and doesn't allow it to  exit it. Please read and fix this bug. You were one of the best apps I've  ever had and kept for so long, please don't ruin this now. Cheers! - Logan  M.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""60"", ""review-text"": ""  At first this app was a nice way to take an afternoon break from work  everyday (I work from home and go to the gym in the morning). I chose an  advanced course which would decide for me which workout to do so I didn't  have to waste time thinking. However after two weeks it was the same mix of  about 10 exercises everyday. On the one hand it was nice but too think, on  the other I was pretty bored.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  Would give it more stars if I could.

When it works, its  great tho.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  Combined with healthier eating choices and lifestyle choices this app  actually helped me A LOT when I lost 30 pounds a year or so back! I've  since fallen out of my routine due to unforseen circumstances but I'm  excited to get back into my groove and get my weight back down again. I  think the most helpful thing is that they show you what exercises to do and  how to do them. Makes it a great app for beginners.

I find Endomondo MUCH to my preference -- that way you'll get your  Vitamin D the best way :-D Truly I do NOT like this app, too little of any  particular feature, not enough of the right features -- NOT for serious  people, except, maybe, for gym junkies.
