Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  I was turned away from a.gym. I had lost all hope. This app has shown me that u can love and eat real good and it's ok. I've only lost about 9lbs so far. Thank u   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  Love the recipes, but it really needs to breakdown what's a portion size. Made Baked Omelet Cups as a quick morning meal and don't know how many I'm supposed to eat for a single meal. Would like to see more videos for exercises for people with knee issues that can't get down on the floor or do weight bearing on knees. Weights and measures don't always show up in the activity and journal. Then the last thing that would be great is a place to track water consumption. Using my Fitbit for that now, but would be nice to have in the app as well. Thank you!   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  I love how motivating the app is. I like how it feels they're right there with me. I did have some issues though, my first inital pictures and measurements were lost by the 1st weigh in, I was honestly upset by it. I love how the app tells you when to speed up and slow down on the 30 second interval training but for some reason it doesn't do that on the 2 .30 min training. I hated that.. i had to keep checkkng my phone when the time was to go or stop. I wish the app floods in my rounds on time... for example how long it took ke each round so that in the future i can look back and say it took me this long each round.. other than that I love the app. I use it everyday. I love the connection community on facebook. I have never had such an outpouring of love and support from anyother page. Honestly if you are starting fresh or continuing on your fitness journey this app is for you. So motivating and uplifting.

Between the wide selection of meals, Chris and Heidi's personal messages everyday to help you get ready to workout, and the videos to help with minset, shopping, good days and bad...  i can't say enough!   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  Overall, a great app. I wish that the meal plan suggestions for the day would vary more without having to go into each meal and choosing something appropriate, there are days, for example, where almost all of the suggested meals are shakes, seems like there could be a way that the app suggested a more balanced variety. Also, sometimes when doing the workouts the counter for the rest period will count up rather than down so you have to watch it to see when the specific amount of time has elapsed rather than have the audio cues which exist when it is working properly. An option to track calories and the actual meals consumed would be helpful as well. Overall, this app is a great tool to add to a fitness toolbox.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  Love this app...I have been using the Transform app for a little over 3 months and have lost 38 lbs. I absolutely love how this program has nutrition (variation of delicious recipes), workouts, and weekly life lessons. There is also a wonderful support group where members can share their experiences and tips. One thing that I would love to see on this app would be the ability to log your own meals and macros.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  It's great except you can't record what you are if you deviated from the  recipe.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  This app is great for laying out a nutrition & fitness plan that's backed by science AND easy to follow. It spells out ev-ry-thing for you to do :) Plus, through the app you can be connected to a supportive community of fellow 'Transformers'. If I could change things, they would be (1) ability to put in actual meals & snacks (for better or worse) to have an accurate record of intake, and (2) if a workout is skipped, be able to show a record of making it up. [I have a suspicion that these aren't current features because the program is intended to be completed as they've set it up; but, these updates would be nice both for accuracy/integrity, and if you need to problem solve any lack of progress.]   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  The Transform App really is ingenious. i wonder about whoever designed it because they did a brilliant job in trying to incorporate all we need to start taking control of our health and our lives. That's a tall order. But it is presented in a way that is user friendly and not intimidating and the profram itself is broken into bite size pieces so we are not overwhelmed. i would love a little more flexibility with the menus--if we did go out to a restaurant not on the fast food list, how can i enter in my food so I stay on track anyway? Thanks Chris & Heidi! So glad i joined the challenge. #determined   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  This app is fantastic!

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  This is my go-to app for every ache, pain, ailment, sickness or mood swing under the sun.  Absolutely love that there's a 'notes' section and a place to take notes for each single oil, blend, type of use/application & for every symptom/illness.  This app is super user friendly, the Vita Flex charts are a wonderful reference to have at my fingertips & the search bar for anything under the 'Guide' section is fabulously useful.   I have shown this app to several other people who have decided to spend the $7-8 (whatever it costs, I forget since I've had it so long) on it because it's so much easier than flipping thru a super thick book to find the info that is just a few clicks away in this app.   I had chest pains from anxiety and almost went into the hospital because of it. I looked up heart/chest pains in the guide and found Ylang Ylang and Aroma Life as a suggestion to diffuse or breathe in directly from the bottle. I tried it and within minutes my chest pain was gone and I was calm and relaxed.  I tried this out on a few friends who were having anxiety attacks and crying from mental breakdowns and it had the same effect on them. Within a few minutes their eyes were clear and they were smiling again.  I have, without even trying to do so, made a few non-believers actually begin to believe in the power of essential oils and aroma therapy bc of the help listed in this app!  Absolutely recommend 100%! Especially if you use Young Living essential oils, as many of the blends are Young Living's own and you may not find them from other companies.   Hands down the best essential oil reference guide app I've ever had the pleasure of using! Thank you so much!

""The popular Couch to 5K app helps new runners avoid injury from doing too much, too soon.""
—Runners World, June 2012
""It's ridiculously easy to use (it's hard not to, as you just do what you're told) and it's fantastic that you have an encouraging voice talking you through things.""
—Engadget, June 2012
""Active.com’s Couch to 5K is one of my favorite… apps. With its customizable features, interactivity, and well-rounded interface, I may actually stay off the couch this time.""
—148Apps, October 2011
""I knew as soon as I decided to start the Couch to 5K program that I would need something to keep me accountable—not just to showing up for my training, but to actually doing it properly. Of course there’s an app for that.""
—CalorieLab, April 2012
""If you have been struggling to get your buns off the couch and somewhat in shape before the summer hits, training for a 5K is not a bad way to start. If you are looking for a program to help get you there, then the “Couch to 5K” running plan by CoolRunning is probably your best bet if you haven’t done an ounce of athletic activity for a number of years.""

I like sketching out a basic shape and see height differences to then refine a bit more and add notes to certain points on my route. So far the UI and putting down points on a map has frustrated me so much I'd rather make a route on the browser version rendering this app a bit useless. Please consider giving some functionality you have on the browser to the mobile app. Let us pinch and zoom in while setting up points on the route. When we want to adjust a point on the route let us tap on that point and move it around. If you need to know when to make the next line of the route put it so you only make one when a point is selected. Create midpoint adjusters like on the browser to curve a line a bit better and refine.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""20"", ""review-text"": ""  Don't bother buying if you have a huawei phone.

com.bodbot.trainer,BodBot Personal Trainer: Workout & Fitness Coach,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"500,000+",4.6,"BodBot is a true digital personal trainer, creating workouts tailored to your goals, resources, physical abilities, desired difficulty and much more. Each workout is tailored down to the level of the individual exercises, and the plans adapt over time as you complete or miss sessions.
Just as a good personal trainer will personalize your workout plan, we create an individual program for you and adapt it as you progress. Limited range of motion in the shoulders? We can work to correct that. Weaker in the back than in the chest? We can address that. Hamstrings too tight? Want to develop the biceps or the glutes? Can only workout in a few windows during the week? BodBot can handle it all, and your workouts will reflect all of these needs. We're committed to providing you with the best possible training plan and the very best workouts. More than this, if you miss a workout, or if you decide to go hiking on a whim, we can integrate this new information and update your training plan accordingly. The plan lives and breathes with you and for you.
So what distinguishes a modern, science-based, intimately personalized training system? What does BodBot do - and why does this matter?
■ Personalization matters. If you broke your leg this morning, you probably shouldn’t be attempting heavy squats at night. Similarly, if your sleep has cratered for the past week, or if you suddenly come down with a fever, the previous trajectory of your fitness - along with last week’s view of this week’s best training plan - becomes obsolete. You need a recommendation that reflects your new circumstances.
■ While changes are rarely this dramatic, a missed workout, an unexpected hike, a bout of insomnia or any of life’s other curveballs should not derail you from your training plan or your goals. BodBot can and will handle these changes.
■ People naturally progress at different speeds. Rather than breaking yourself on the yoke of a program that’s either too slow or too fast - too inefficient or wildly risky - it is possible to respond to your rate of progress and adapt the training to reflect your own unique work capacity. BodBot will work with you to set the best pace and rate of progression. By contrast, most apps today either use absolutely no system of progression, or static fixed percentage increments.
■ Everyone has a different history: variations in posture, strength, cardiovascular fitness, range of motion, joint stability, joint mobility and much more. These variations matter. Rather than overloading a weak and unstable joint or hammering an already shortened and tight muscle, BodBot will work with you to improve performance and increase efficiency - through targeted fitness tests and objective assessments. This is not the hand-waving personalization of other fitness apps. This is modern, high quality physiology and kinesiology realized in intelligent training recommendations.
■ Accessibility matters - if you’re working out at home you should still be able to get a high-quality, targeted workout - not an arbitrary infinite loop of burpees, wall-squats and crunches. BodBot’s database of broad and deep exercise profiles, together with the sophisticated algorithms that run over the top of them, seamlessly handle changes in location and equipment. Similarly, schedules can run tight and can change - if your default Monday, Wednesday, Friday pattern is interrupted, or you suddenly have less time available than expected, BodBot will immediately adjust your training plan.
■ Specificity matters - beating about the knees with a tire iron will certainly provoke soreness and perhaps even work up a sweat - but it will not generate favorable improvements in performance (assuming self-assault does not become the new fad) or body composition and certainly not wellness. It’s the type of stimulus, not the magnitude of pain, that dictates results - BodBot will use each and every drop of sweat to help you achieve the results you want.","[{""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  I did have to look up a few exercises just to make sure my form was correct.

Good predictions. However, the analysis part is poor. You can only analyze one value at a time (so only see the blocks for biking but not for swimming). And you can only analyze on which day you entered a tag (but not which tag), and for weight and basal body temperature the same: you can see you filled them in, but the app won't draw a graph.

Uninstalled   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  Updated review: tracks 80 nutrients, provides ratios balance between  nutrients, syncs well with my fitbit app including specific exercises I log  in fitbit. Calorie totals seem more accurate than other sites. It offers me  the option to use additional metrics which I love. So if I want 300 grams  of yogurt, not the 227 gram serving... No problem an easy log! Keto?! No  problem. Not only does it offer 3 different degrees of keto lax - rigorous,  you can also customize your own net car, and ratios for protein limit. You  can add far more metrics than most tracking apps. You can add blood  and/urine ketone levels and more. It auto adds my sleep, heart rate and  weight from fitbit <~ effortless! Improvements I'd love to see -faster  loading when opening... It really takes awhile. I'm used to my fitness pal  so it is incredibly frustrating standing in front of the fridge taping my  toe waiting for it to load so I can scan or add food There was an update  this morning and it did open quickly so if this is a trend I will edit this  portion to reflect increased load speed. -MULTI ADD... please oh please  multi add :P to add a robust meat bacon bits ranch salad is like 7 + times  I have to click add food, search, serving size, click add, click add food  again... Rinse repeat x7. Multi add would require check marks to persist as  you clear the search box and embark on a subsequent search -the projected  calories are WAY off of fitbit (what it's projections are based on) finally  late in the evening they start to almost match... It would be nice not to  have to check how many cals I have left on fitbit everytime I eat, then go  to crono to log -The cals should match fitbit at the end of the day, if  that is my sole source of feeding my BMR (I have an Hr fitbit) and TDEE  into crono... Ie no BMR estimates needed (maybe in settings this could be  an option for Hr activity trackers connected) ... But crono was off daily..  Finally the only fix I could find was to manually change my BMR, 1  increment at a time, altering the crono TDEE each trial, until the total  cals in crono, matched the fitbit TDEE... But BMR is not entirely static,  especially if ones weight is changing. So my eventual 1308 that day is not  my BMR every day, so I would have to go I to settings daily and  incrementally changing my crono BMR estimate (at the end of the day) to  post match cals burned... It would be so nice to just open crono and see a  TDEE based on my fitbit Hr BMR. If you are importing your TDEE from fitbit  it should match fitbit, not estimate BMR in such a way that even armed with  fitbit data returns a different TDEE at days end. I like crono reports so I  want to be able to rely on it for an accurate to fitbit TDEE/BMR count  especially when generating reports for weeks of time, vs a single day where  I can mentally remind myself my tdee was 2135 not 2115. -tiny bug... When  you tweak aka edit a custom recipe, it u stars ot from your favorites. And  there is no ability to star it again in the food list, as clicking on it  merely opens the edit mode, not the presentation mode with stats and the  \u00f0\u009f\u008c\u009f... So to restart it one has to go back to diary, click add food, search  for the title of your recipe, click it, star it, and back out... I change  my ice cream recipes daily to fit nutritional needs so daily I have to  restar and the faves matter because it allows for it to come up without  needing the full title -widgets for cals burned, cals left, and a quick  add/quick scan shortcut or widget Hope these suggestions are helpful. It  truly is an amazing.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""60"", ""review-text"": ""  Especially when I'm doing a restorative yoga practice, the app continually skips instrcutions or poses altogether, forcing me to rewind to where I think I left off in order to continue my practice.

This situation doesn't call for relaxation when you constantky have to interrupt your practice.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  I absolutely love this app. Never have any problems with app, voice commands or video. It is great how you can choose the type of workout (what length of time, workout level eg beginner, music and voice commands you want). The one thing I would love to see on there is a function so you can eliminate certain poses that aren't suitable for an individual and also a function where you can put together your own workout from a list of poses. That, I would absolutely pay for! Having rods in my spine prevents any backbends such as camel pose etc and they are other people out there having the same issues so I am sure it would be great to be able to remove these from the workout. I have suggested the app to a few people but some of them are beginners and have hip and other problems, so being able to customise would allow these people to get your app. The other huge advantage this would have is if you get an injury you can customise your workout around it. Thank you so much for a great app. For anybody thinking of trying it absolutely do it, you won't regret it!   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  Sync to google fit stopped. The yoga session is good. Standard quality video are way more clear compared to other apps, but this makes them heavy and slow to load. its a good app, but still a trainer would be better.

It has many options for creating custom sessions that work offline after being saved. The photos are fine & use less data than video. I liked Down Dog so much I bought a pro subscription so I could use 'boost' & other options. I'm holding back a star because: (1) The quoted hype about 'always-changing' & 'randomized' sequences is misleading. The algorithm generates a predictable sequence for each combination of settings. (2) My saved sessions are listed in chronological order. It would help A LOT if I could sort/filter by name, type, length, etc. (3) The app uses a lot of storage; please add the option to move it to the SD card. (4) The app doesn't promptly log all of my completed sessions. (5) The app would be more user friendly if it had a user guide & more details in the online FAQ. (6) I'd value having more practice options, such as hatha & yin sessions (longer than the restorative sessions), or an option to include specific poses. | Overall, it's an excellent app that has some room for improvement.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  Much better with the addition of new voices. Needs to be able to move the app and/or saved workouts to SD card. Too much warrior pose.

com.eatthismuch,Eat This Much - Meal Planner,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"500,000+",4.3,"Put your diet on autopilot with Eat This Much, the automatic meal planner. Tell us your diet goals, the foods you like, your budget, and what your schedule looks like, and we'll automatically generate a complete meal plan to meet your requirements. It's like having a personal diet assistant.
Features
•  Generate meal plans that meet your calorie and macro targets in seconds
•  Nutrition targets can be set up for weight loss, maintenance, or muscle / bodybuilding
•  Follow any eating style or create your own
•  Choose from paleo, atkins/keto, vegetarian, vegan, and Mediterranean diets
•  Filter out foods/recipes based on allergies and dislikes, including gluten-free
•  Set the available cooking time for each meal to match your schedule
•  Take the anxiety out of picking what to eat
•  Personalize any of our recipes or add your own
•  Don't like our suggestions? Easily swap them out or configure the meal planner to only use foods you like using Recurring Foods
Premium features
•  Automatically generate a week of meal plans at a time
•  Didn’t follow the meal plans? Easily log what you did eat to track your intake
•  Grocery lists are automatically created from your meal plans
•  Set a number of family members for each meal to make sure you buy enough groceries
•  Reduce food waste with pantry tracking
•  Set custom targets for each day of the week, like more calories and carbs on your workout days. Customize as much or as little as you want.
Normal calorie trackers force you to add foods into your diary one by one. By the end of the day, there's no guarantee that you'll be anywhere near your nutrition targets. With our automatic meal planner, there's nothing to track because everything is already entered for you. All you have to do is follow the plan.
We offer both free accounts and premium accounts. As a free user, you can create a single day meal plan and completely customize it however you want. Each meal can have different preferences, and your nutrition targets can be whatever you like.
As a premium user, you'll have access to the weekly meal planner that allows you to automatically generate a week of meal plans and send them to you with a grocery list via email. As you follow the plans, you can track what you did or didn't eat, and if you deviate from the plans, we make it easy to readjust your targets for the next week to stay on track.
Try out the free account to see if our meal plans appeal to you, and upgrade to the premium meal planner when you're ready.

Everything you need is here to  succeed. It has changed my life for the better.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  For years with calorie count diets, my husband has complained to me about  how little his portions were, and how 'You won't let me eat anything', as  if I were the food police. I insisted that WE BOTH buy this app on our  phones, so it goes everywhere with us. We learned a points diet that allows  you freedom to eat. He aquates his points to money, and I hear him say, ' I  can't afford that'. Finally, I can retire my food police hat, and relax. We  have been on this app for a week and a half, and I am down in weight by  8.2lbs with daily exercise, and he is down 5lbs without exercise...I guess  that will be our next hurdle. This app is outstanding, it tracks your daily  progress, weight loss toward goal progress, exercise, has an excellent  scanner for labels, and a huge online data base. This makes counting points  so easy. I literally could not say enough good things about this app.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  Tracking PPs is easier with this app than the WW version was, quicker and  laid out better too! ** UPDATE ** I have lost 15kgs, in less than 5 months,  thanks to UFVD.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  This app has been an amazing tool. My husband and I both wanted to join  Weight Watchers but had heard negative reviews of the new Freestyle  Program. We wanted to do the older Points Plus & this allows us to do it.  We've only been using the app for 3 weeks but together we've lost 27 lbs!  (17 for him (men!!!) & 10 for me). The only negative thing I can say about  the app is that you can only use whole or half portions so there's no way  to do a 1/4 cup or 3/4 of a cup etc..... other than that this app has been  a godsend. I wholeheartedly recommend it.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  I don't find it that user friendly especially when trying to search for  different foods. Not overly enjoying using it to be honest   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""60"", ""review-text"": ""  Up until this morning, I really liked this app.  It wasn't as slick as some of the other food trackers, but for the price it was pretty good , even if it's a little clunky.

I could not connect to the online database.  I tried restarting my phone.  Then I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, which I've done before to reset and fix issues.  However, today the app did an automate backup which erased my previous backup, and then re-set itself to settings over a month old.  Since it performed a blank backup, about a month's worth of historical data, meals, food favorites, and notes are all gone.  Unfortunately, customer support cannot help me either.  I was using this track gastrointestinal issues, and all that data is erased now.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  Love this app! I canceled my WW membership because it was just too dang expensive to keep up with and I really just couldn't get used to the whole Freestyle plan. I bought the premium subscription on this app so I could go back to using Smart Points and I am very happy and once again motivated to continue on with my journey. My only minor gripe is sometimes the widgets on Android don't show my information properly. I like being able to see how many points I've used/have left and sometimes the widget will show that I've used 0 points etc until I open the app up again and it'll re-update itself. Not a major thing though, it doesn't stop me from tracking, etc. I'd recommend this app over iTrackBites, it's more visually appealing (iTrackBites looks extremely outdated in terms of grapics/layout) and it's a bit easier to navigate.

Also, changed phones and since I don't pay for this app monthly (already paid to download it) I lost all of the history. // I needed an app to replace a very out of date one for Weight Watchers tracking. What I really wanted was something to track points (food and exercise), with a food database. This app so far exceeds my expectations. I was able to transfer my history over, build meals and save them for use later, calculate points for items at restaurants (huge database, had everything I needed) and the cherry on top is the bar code scanner. I scanned even the most obscure generic things and they were found. The serving sizes were calculated and the point values assigned. This app is everything I had before, with way more convenience and features. I was super skeptical about paying for it, but seeing all the great reviews made it worth the try. I'm super glad I did.

I was frustrated with other apps, but this one is  definitely premium quality. keep it free and keep up the good work.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  Get this app, it has a heat map so you can visually see during that 2 minute period you thought you were killing it you actually slowed down. I enjoy it mostly because I with the heat map i compare previous runs and can see my improvement.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  Good app overall. Only complaint is the indicator for your fastest split time needs to be fixed. For example, I like to finish runs strong and my last quarter of a mile is typically my fastest. However, say I am running 4 miles and sprint the last quarter and then stop the app right at 4 miles, the app always picks up an additional 0.1 or 0.2 miles and says that last little bit is my fastest split. There needs to be away to program the app before you run and say 'I want to run 4 miles'. This would allow the app to cut off right at 4 miles and provide an accurate account of the fastest split. It would also allow for a reverse countdown..'you have 3.75 miles left'. Other than that, great app!

I begrudgingly accepted the full-screen ads when I ended a workout but then it started talking at me which is just way too intrusive.

In the end, you are the one who needs to lose the weight, and make sure things you don't want to eat don't pass your lips. This app, however, can hold you accountable and help you see what you have done in the day. I love it and will continue to use it. I have lost 4 pounds in just a few days because I chose to put in the work. This app is just meant to be a reminder and an estimated number for your progress. I know I have not used this app long, but I like it a lot and I like the feeling of satisfaction of getting to the end of the day and liking the number I see on my screen. Even if it isnt correct down to the atom, I appreciate it can tell me my numbers and statistics. I also like that it can estimate a day that goals will be reached, as that can give me a good understanding of how long I will be in this for. Recommend 100%.

Haven't. Even. Eaten. Yet. And I'm not getting the weekly weight reminders anymore. The hydration counter is also horribly inaccurate - under-logs my intake by half or more some days. And the barcode scanner half the time takes a picture of your food instead of looking it up. I'm not into sharing pictures of my protein bar; I just want a quick way of putting data in my log. Get the free version if you want a calorie log but don't waste your money or time with the paid one. If I didn't have a vast offline data pool after using this app for years I'd drop it. Update: I wish I could give NO stars. Added a new exercise regimen to my life: barre. Guess how many calories this app says I burned in 1 hour? ZERO. Really?? Where do they get their data? And you can't edit erroneous exercise data like you can food data. Update - the stupid, condescending pop ups have been reduced a good deal, to the point I too the plunge on the lifetime premium version and now the app is PAINFULLY slow and crashes several times a day; it usually takes me longer to record my lunch than eat it and I am a fairly slow eater!

Some improvements that could be made would be the  ability to see what the nutrition of items are before you add them to  meals.

There are  a few things that makes it not perfect. Well it doesn't have full info on  some foods like krystals ingredients. Another would be the food list being  confusing with multiple listing of the same food with a different picture  so it also clogs up the list making it longer. Last one for now would be  the ratings which be off or changes for no reason. Example food A has 3  things in the red while 5 being cautious ingredients and it gets a B  rating. Food B has nothing really that bad with no red alerts and probably  1 in the grey but gets a C rating.

The actual training program is varied enough to be engaging and it's appropriately challenging. User feedback changes the next week in the right way.  What the app needs badly: The ability to edit workouts and integration with other Freeletics programs like a single portal for all of the programs.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  I love this app and the other two apps, like other reviewers my primary  comments are: first, there should be some way to integrate the three apps  in order to optimize your workouts. And second, it would be nice if there  was a way to identify what exactly you have access to... I only have an  Olympic bar (20kg / 45lbs) and not the lighter bars that it is trying to  have me start with. I can do the exercises, but it would be nice if I could  get it to properly account for weight.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""60"", ""review-text"": ""  I subscribe to coach and pay monthly for their service which I enjoy. The only reason this is a 3 star review is because the app seems to be hastily put together when it comes to selecting how much weight you are lifting. It's always missing numbers, there will be an entire list of options in 5lb increments and they'll have everything except for 60lbs. Sometimes you need that weight that's missing from the list. I've contacted customer service and they've forwarded the probleem on to the technical staff. It wouldn't bother me so much if i just used the free service, but I pay $12 a month for the this. I'm thinking about cancelling and checking out my other options.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  I used the paid version for about 6 months and definitely made good progress. It's easy to follow. I liked  the videos and timer.  Workouts are challenging. This would be a 5 star app if it included more variety, e.g. dumbbells.  Some days I just make up my own routine to get out of the monotony of the same workouts.  It also dovetails well with Freeletics bodyweight. The member network didn't work out for me since I'm a senior in a small city.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  I love freeletics gym. I workout in my garage so i don't run into the same problems as others.

Third instead three apps make it one app and integrate all the workouts in the plan. But overall great app!   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  The app is great but it is not public gym friendly for the workouts as every upper body and lower body exercise requires if to be a smooth exercises, 2 barbells. It's not conducive to have a single bar bell and constantly changing the weights for 2 types of exercises within a set.   Especially in a public gym where it's virtually impossible to tell another gym user that hey I'm gonna use 2 bar bells bear with me.

In a short matter of time at the gym, I feel like I got in a good workout and feel I am progressively getting stronger. This only allows for barbell exercises and is all superset. The challenges are, well, challenging and the combination of movements get the job done. One thing I really miss: dumbbells. Maybe some day...   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  The app works well; I don't remember any crashes. The coach provides tailored workouts. The downside is that it requires you to have access to different weights, benches, etc for smooth transitions throughout the workout. I recommend adding dumbbell option to replace barbell. Also should let user choose available equipment and build workout around that.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  Amazing weight training app. All the workouts are designed with least equipment usage. All you need is a barbell, bench, plates, squat rack and pull up bar. The regimes contain compound movements only which is good for improving overall fitness.

I made great improvements in strength and physique so far. The app does not train for you though so you still have to be dedicated to achieve good results. However, the app itself could use some maintenance and really falls behind the bodyweight app. It is not integrated in the community and there are a lot of simple changes that would significantly enhance the experience with the app. Also I wished there would be a more diverse warm-up and stretching/cooling down part. Those get boring quite easily which is unnecessary because the are so many cool and fun things to do! In total my experience with the app is positive.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""60"", ""review-text"": ""  I have used Bodyweight for almost 2 years, and now decided to try Gym, and I miss the social part of it, and some small improvements, like being able to complete an exercise later, if there is a communication problem with the app. Also, it doesn't make sense all the changes in weights and using 2 bars at the same time... The app is fine, but needs some of the improvements that Bodyweight already has. There has been no updates to this app since May2017, which is a shame.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""60"", ""review-text"": ""  It is a decent app to workout in a Gym. Daily sets are small, 3-4 exercises, and not so tough. I have been using the coach but it feels like 'not enough' if you're serious about training (but if you are, either you are capable of building your personal schedule or you have a PT). I find the weight selection a bit clumsy and confusing: you can select a target weight which is barbell+disks but the barbell has always a fixed weight. In the app it does change! At the end of the training, then, the weight recap is always much more; like if it's counting the disks weight twice. That's *confusing*   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  This is a great concept but the lack of variety let's the app down. I'm 4 weeks into my coach subscription and I'm getting bored with the lack of variety.

The app says they work on the reviews but looks like they didn't read my last comment, and the degradation of star. The exercises get repetitive and extensively boring.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  Great for starting! Lots of exercises available with even more behind a pay wall.

I'd like to pair it with bodyweight app. And it's nit public gym friendly if you need several bars with different weights. So I just use the same weights (I'm female). Use it on my compact phone,  display could be bigger so I don't always have to pick up the phone to see what's next. I would also like a preview of weights coming up (I lift, but I can't use same weight for lifting for endurance).  Still 4 stars cause it works well, is easy to use.

I paid to this greedy company a lot of money in the past, just to see it all lost to an update that completely misses the point of the app's former straightforwardness.

Edit: while some of the purchases can now be restored, not all will be (an instructor is missing completely \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so the restore option is incomplete and false). Furthermore, the app is still bloated and confusing. The subscription offering is ridiculous. Will not be using this anymore.

I follow the creator's youtube channel. In the app, it's easy to  navigate from your workouts to your calendar or meal plans. I love how she  added her videos from youtube. It's well organized, and I have no trouble  with the app. When opening the app the screen went black for some time and  I had to close and reopen it. However, i think it has to do with an  overload issue or something that the creator mentioned in her newest video  promoting this app. It's pretty minor if you ask me. Also, ive been  reopening the app several times now and it didnt happen again. I like how  she includes some words to guide the user through the app. For those who  are annoyed that most of her workouts and meal plans aren't available for  free, please be understanding. Cassey has tons of free, quality workout  videos uploaded on youtube.

I love having access to everything in an easy-to-use format; however,  I feel there are a couple things that could be changed. 1. I wish we could  modify the timer. When first starting PIIT, not everyone can do the 45  second on, 15 second off format. Being able to change the length of  rounds/rest/and time between rounds would be great. That would maximize the  customization of the workouts! 2. There should be a way to make a grocery  list, both from the recipes and for personal use. Instead of writing it  down or needing another app, it would save time to be able to save it in  the app. 3. It would be nice to have the playlists for that day's calendar  easily available.

Everything is so organized allowing you to easily find  anything from the workout you scheduled for today to the delicious recipe  you made a few weeks ago. Furthermore, all the recipes look soo good (I  haven't tried any yet but I am planning to soon) and there's a huge variety  of recipes for any picky eaters out there. I also love the connection to  Spotify and YouTube that allows you to listen to music while doing interval  training in addition to having access to all of Cassie's videos straight  from the app! My only complaint is that only three interval style in-app  piit workouts are available for those who don't pay. I've always been kinda  self conscious working out in front of other people, so I've only ever  really worked out with YouTube videos at my house, meaning I've also never  really been able to workout with music. This app would've helped soo much  with maintaining a healthy lifestyle through my transition to college. And  as a college student, I obviously can't afford the yearly subscription  price, so I just wish there were more in-app workout options for free. But  other than that I really do LOVE the app!   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  Hey. I think this app is great and I love how it supports a realistic  healthy lifestyle. A great part about it is when you open the app, you are  greeted by Cassey's friendly face and it guides you through everything you  need to know about the app. One thing I think should be considered for  further updates is being able to enter your own healthy recipes or alter  the existing ones due to everyone being different. Another thing I think  would be a great addition to the app is having a 'live' section where (for  example) every Monday at 10:00 Cassey will do a live workout and all  subscribers can watch, which will also help to keep users excited about the  app. I love that you offer a free version of the subscription and allow  users to adapt the app to their different lifestyles.

I am updating my previous review here and cutting out past reviews. This review is for the 18.8.1 Version.  I have my starting point for my bike rides and when I cross each mile marker, MapMyRide is reading out my Status at the accurate distance at each mile marker.  I love that MapMyRide has added the time and battery level display feature. Now I know what time it is and how much battery level I have as I ride. Thanks MapMyRide.  I do recommend this app.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""20"", ""review-text"": ""  This app has tons of issues with pausing. Once it took four miles to unpause and begin counting my progress. If I stop at a coffeeshop it often continuously pauses/unpauses with no button to fully freeze the app. There doesn't seem to be any sign that they are fixing this terrible issue.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  I've been using this app for over 6 years. Since upgrading to Oreo it is no longer capable of tracking my GPS. I've tried everything. I've followed all of their suggestions. It'll occasionally track a workout here and there (weeks apart), but generally it doesn't work anymore and I have to enter the data manually. Don't worry - it'll still show you those ads every chance it gets - even after you've left the app. Shame.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  This app is a lot better than it was a few years ago. I used to always have trouble with the GPS tracking, but now it works great.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  So I have been using this app for a week while riding my bike and for some reason it won't track the entire workout. I'm in the middle of a city with great service so I don't see what the problem is. I'll ride for 7 - 8 miles around the city but it only logs 1.5 - 2 miles of it and no I'm not pausing the workout. Defeats the point of using it if it can't accurately track my distance.

But this app is seriously amazing.  It's feature packed but let me just talk about one area. I'm doing the  foundation course right now, and the exercises are such a unique approach  to meditation and so easy to follow. For example, the intentionally build a  break in for letting your mind wander, so that you understand the nature of  the monkey mind as a opposed to the stillness you get from meditating. The  narrator's voice was unusual to me at first because of the very slight  Indian accent, but now I find it even more relaxing than a typical US or UK  accented voice.

The instructor has a very soothing (although focused) voice which works for me, and his accent is a pleasure to hear. Not only the course collection is extensive, but Aware also has short energisers, in addition to more extended exercises for daily activities (such as commuting and cooking, although I'm honest to say I haven't yet tried them), which I am sure will fit my every meditation need. A bonus feature which is, as far as I know, nowhere to be found in similar apps is integration with Google Fit, for those of us who like to keep statistics and numbers in check. I currently have a 1-year subscription to Calm, but over time I found not only the voice of the instructor a bit annoying; also, her instructions patronising at times and a little over the top since it involves more lecturing than letting the user actually meditate.

For example, it doesn't preference generic versions of things like apples, meat, eggs, etc over specific brands of these which can be irritating. Overall, quite good and I'd recommend.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  It used to be 5 star, but now it's much less. The app is not compatible with Samsung Gearfit devices. The steps counts are grossly inflated and the calorie counts show negative adjustments of 390 calories on every workout day, no matter what the activity is. So it is impossible to track any nutrition. I have been emailing support for over 3 months and have received replies that 'sometimes some updates take longer than others.' When i asked for an estimate on when it will be fixed, I was told 'there is no estimated time for this fix.' I understand wait times, but over 3 months is unacceptable.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  Well done for a calorie tracking interface. The app is structured quite good. There is one thing I would like changed though - integrate a Food database with the barcode scanner separately, where all food items can be added and stored for adding daily food searches (like when i go to the stores and add all food choices via the scanner) . At this stage, adding food can only be done within the daily food list. If that item gets removed, the food item in the 'quick reference list' is removed also and the food item needs to be seached again from internet database to be added.

The food database is extensive. I frequently found the brand I was looking for. My only complaint is the syncing of Samsung Health for the step count. It sometimes doesn't work.

Love the food tracking, recipes etc. However, it is very hit and miss with Google fit.

It's an amazing app and no other app that I have tried comes close. It has many resources, recipes, challenges & helpful articles. The most underutilized part is the social media aspect. The profile, friends list, posts and wall are less than desirable but I don't mind because I use this app for my personal needs/goals and I don't need another Facebook or Instagram.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  I like MFP. I started using it about 6 years ago to help me stay on track to lose weight over the course of a year for a wedding I was going to be in. Had I stayed with it, I would probably be much healthier! Even though I haven'tbused the app in years, it still has all my login info and welcomed me back. This is a good 'self serve' type of app. If you need more guidance like what to eat and when to eat it, you may want to try something else. If you have a pretty good idea of what you are doing and just need an accountability measure, then this app is great! If you want to pay, I think things get more specialized, but I may never know because I plan to continue only with the free version.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""60"", ""review-text"": ""  Running really slow just doing basic tasks with no other apps open. Also the barcode scanner doesn't work.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""20"", ""review-text"": ""  Newest version will not let me log in or log foods without an internet connection. When I have a spotty connection this is very inconvenient and there is no reason for it other than obviously they want to be able to load more ads. No way to turn off my fitness pal blog spam on my homepage even though I do not find it useful and it just gets in the way of my seeing my friends activity. Often slows down and crashes for no apparent reason. Often copies Foods at random and I have to delete the duplicates later. Abuses inordinate amounts of data even when I'm not using it so I have turned off background data and urge others to do the same. Also uses CPU in background for no apparent reason, I recommend killing the app when you are not actively using it to avoid whatever it is doing in the background (draining your battery, downloading ads, perhaps even spying on you.)   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  I'm a vegetarian and I'm using this app to track nutrition, exercise, and weight loss. It's amazing for this purpose, as long as you're someone who looks at calories as one more gage towards health and not the be-all-end-all.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""60"", ""review-text"": ""  I really liked this app, gave a lot of information about all nutritional values, not just calories. Plan on entering your own food though. Maybe 5% of the information on there is right, or half right. And then you have to go through the entire list of every kind of food to compare what you actually have. At least if you want the calories your tracking to be correct. Its really time consuming, which defeats the purpose.

I do think, however, that there should be a level in between intermediate and advanced.

com.northcube.sleepcycle,Sleep Cycle alarm clock,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"1,000,000+",4.5,"Sleep Cycle introduces sound analysis - sleep tracking with no need to place the device in bed.
WAKING UP MADE EASY
Sleep Cycle is an intelligent alarm clock that tracks your sleep patterns and wakes you up in light sleep - the natural way to wake up, feeling rested and energised.
HOW IT WORKS
As you sleep, you go through different sleep phases, ranging from light to deep sleep and back again. The sleep phase you are in when your alarm goes off is critical for how tired or rested you will feel when you wake up.
While you sleep, your movements vary depending on what sleep phase you are in. Sleep Cycle’s patented technology tracks your sleep patterns using sound or vibration analysis, monitoring your movements in bed throughout the different sleep phases.
Sleep Cycle finds the optimal time when you are in light sleep to wake you up in the morning, during a predefined 30 minute time window that ends at your set alarm time. Waking up in the lightest sleep phase feels like waking up naturally without an alarm, leaving you feeling rested and energized.
All you need to do is turn Sleep Cycle on before going to bed, and place your device on your nightstand or close by on the floor.
FREE FEATURES

- Detailed sleep statistics and daily sleep graphs

Helps you through the difficult first month of your quit - and beyond
This is the app that science built. Proven techniques to help you stop smoking are delivered in a beautifully clear and very human way. The calculator tells you how much money you've saved and how many cigarettes you've not smoked, the calendar tells you how long you’ve been smoke free and how much life you've regained, bars show you how giving up smoking is improving your health, and a diary shows how your cravings for cigarettes are decreasing over time. Plus filling it out seems to help, even if you only use it to vent.
Filling it out also helps us, because this is the app that science is building. If you give us permission, we’ll use the information you give us to learn how to help even more people stop smoking. As you know, quitting smoking is hard. But tens of thousands of people do it successfully each month. We want to know more about what works and what doesn’t and your data can help future quitters quit.
The quit process
Here’s what we know so far. The science is pretty clear that nicotine replacement therapy helps people stop smoking. But it needs to be taken as directed (many people don’t complete the course) and that means it’s best if you get it from your doctor rather than the pharmacist. But don’t worry if you don’t want to use NRT, this is your quit, you do what works for you. The other golden rule about giving up smoking is to make your mantra ‘not one more puff’. Because one puff almost always leads to more and you’re soon back smoking again. It doesn’t seem to matter how much confidence you’ve got about quitting and nor does it matter if you plan your quit ahead or quit or the spur of the moment. The social support you get from programs such as Stoptober are helpful but what really seems important is getting a real understanding of how much progress you’ve made, all the benefits you gain from giving up smoking and all that you’d have to lose by starting smoking again. Giving you that is the core way this app hopes to keep you smoke free.
Electronic cigarettes
E-cigs seem to help lots of people stop smoking.  The ones that look like cigarettes seem less effective than ones you get from specialist vape shops. They also seem pretty safe, much safer than smoking cigarettes. However, we don’t have much long-term evidence so it’s probably best to use them as a way to stop smoking, rather than a replacement for cigs.
The experiment
We’re running an on-going experiment that tests different things to help people give up smoking. Everyone gets all the features mentioned above, the calculator that shows how many cigarettes you've not smoked, the calendar that tells you how long you’ve been smoke free, the bars that show how your health has improved from giving up smoking.
Some people will get additional features. We can’t tell you what they are, partly because it might invalidate the experiment, partly because they change frequently. Don’t feel you’re missing out though. We don’t know if these things will help people stop smoking, we just want to learn whether they do. Don’t worry that they’ll want to make you smoke more either. We would never try anything we thought might make people more likely to smoke.
This is all entirely voluntary and you can use the app fully without taking part in the experiment. But everyone who does take part will help the quitters who follow. So do yourself a favor by stopping smoking. And do your fellow smokers a favor by helping them understand how it’s done.","[{""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  This app. has made me accountable and I like that.

""Let me tell you, if you do have trouble sleeping, try it, because it really works."" -His Royal Highness, The Duke of York
“Give Pzizz a try! Love that app and helps me fall asleep or nap on command.” -Daniel Weinard, Co-founder of Shopify
Featured in The New York Times, WIRED, Engadget, Gizmodo, Product Hunt, Lifehacker, Mashable, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated and more!
PRESS MENTIONS
“…Hibbert credits the app for helping cure his insomnia and diminish his postgame dependence on Ambien.” – NBA Star Roy Hibbert speaking to Sports Illustrated
“That night, I nestled under my covers, downloaded the full version of Pzizz and turned it on… I was out before 20 minutes had passed and haven't looked back since.” - Jenna Wortham, New York Times
“Pzizz helps you get to sleep faster and get more restful sleep with a combination of soothing sounds and voice cues aimed at helping you relax, destress, and get to sleep. In my experience, it works really well.” - Adam Pash, Lifehacker
HOW IT WORKS
Pzizz delivers sleep at the push of a button! Using the science of psychoacoustics (see our website for in-depth details), the app's patented system plays you ""dreamscapes""— a sleep-optimized mix of music, voiceover, and sound effects that changes each night, to quickly quiet your mind, put you to sleep, keep you asleep, and then wake you up feeling refreshed.
If you want to sleep better at night or take incredible power naps during the day, this is the app for you! All you have to do is listen to Pzizz. Headphones/earbuds are recommended for optimal effectiveness, but your built-in phone speaker will work too.
SLEEP MODULE
Beat your insomnia with our 'sleep module' to fall asleep fast, stay asleep, and wakeup feeling refreshed. Personalize your sleep experience with customizable options including an energetic “Wakeup;” three and a half minutes of music crafted to gently bring you back from slumber and start your day with energy.
NAP MODULE
Napping has been proven to enhance performance, alertness, and improve your mood. Customize your naps with our specially designed nap narrations and music. Get rid of that groggy feeling and improve your overall well-being.
FOCUS MODULE
The 'focus module' is music designed to help you get more work done.
Built around ‘focuscapes,’ environments of sound that help you get in the zone and be productive, backed by the same thorough research we use to create our dreamscapes.
Each focuscape has a ‘focus’ section which gets you into full concentration and a ‘cooldown’ section which brings you back out gently.
WHAT MAKES PZIZZ SO MUCH BETTER?
*Simplicity* Sleep at the push of a button! Unlike other sleep solutions, you don’t have to change your behavior, keep a sleep diary, or limit your activities. Just listen to Pzizz, and enjoy incredible sleep.
*No Side Effects* Our only side effect is sleep! Unlike medications or supplements, you’ll never have to worry about adverse effects.
*Variety* Every time you listen to Pzizz it creates a unique session for you. This ensures your brain doesn’t get fatigued from hearing the same things over and over again, and helps maintain effectiveness over time.
*Highly customizable* Adjust sleep duration, volumes, 3D effect, and voice gender for a fully personalized listening experience.
*Clinically Validated* Pzizz is incredibly effective and clinically validated. Read more about the science behind Pzizz at blog.pzizz.com.

ROCKMYRUN LOVE
New York Times: “Music can be a great help to runners, but sometimes putting together a playlist can be a chore. Leave the running song selection up to RockMyRun.”
LA Times: “Great variety; it's easy to find something to your tastes. Choose from oldies, dub step, hip-hop, country and a dozen other genres, then personalize it via preferred beats per minute, clean or explicit lyrics.”
Glamour: “These Pre-Made Music Mixes Will Change Everything”
Natalie Morales, Today Show Co-Anchor: “I am totally am downloading this.”
BACKED BY SCIENCE
RockMyRun was tested by EPARC, a leading exercise research lab, comparing the motivation people feel listening to RockMyRun vs. standard workout playlists.
""The emotional/motivational appeal of the RockMyRun product was clear. The main evidence for this can be seen when examining the IMI, a measurement device intended to assess the subjective experience of running, and the degree to which participant’s enjoyed and felt engaged in the experience. Given that all of the positive subscales of the IMI were statistically significant it seems reasonable to conclude that music that has been mixed together to maintain an optimized beat encourages the listener to experience and internalize more positive feelings about the experience and the outcomes.""

You tie your shoes, put on your headphones, take your first steps outside. You’ve barely covered 100 yards when you hear them. They must be close. You can hear every guttural breath, every rattling groan - they’re everywhere. Zombies. There’s only one thing you can do: Run!
Zombies, Run! is an ultra-immersive running game and audio adventure, co-created with award-winning novelist Naomi Alderman. Every run becomes a mission where you’re the hero, with our immersive audio drama putting you at the centre of your very own zombie adventure story. While you run to the perfect mix of heart-pumping audio drama and pulse-pounding songs from your own playlist, you’ll collect supplies to grow your base back home.
BBC NEWS - “The only way to save yourself is to run for real.”
WIRED - “In the style of Runkeeper, with an exciting undead twist.”
LIFEHACKER - “A really cool way to get outside and exercise.”
CNN - “Turns exercise into a game - a terrifying, terrifying game.”
TIME - ""Takes all the fun of a zombie game and funnels it into a fitness app.""
WALK, JOG, OR RUN ANYWHERE
Zombies, Run! works anywhere and at any speed. You can jog in a park, run along a beach, or walk along a trail. It even works on treadmills!
YOU ARE RUNNER 5
Hundreds of lives are counting on you. You’ve got to rebuild your base from a few shivering survivors into a fortified beacon of civilization by collecting critical supplies and avoiding roving zombie hordes. Can you save them and learn the truth about the zombie apocalypse?
A WORLD OF STORIES
You become the hero in an epic story of humanity’s struggle for survival where your running *really* matters, and there’s a deeper mystery to be uncovered as well. Play the first four missions for free and unlock one extra mission every week.

YOUR OWN MIX

ZOMBIES CHASES
Saving the world not exciting enough? Activate Chases to kick things up a notch. When you hear zombies on your six, it’s time to speed up before they get too close.

DETAILED STATS
View detailed graphs and stats for your entire running and game progress — and check out which songs you play the most while escaping zombies!
KEEP THE SURVIVORS ALIVE

The characters are engaging and the story really  draws you in, you want to keep playing to find out what happens next. As a  fitness app the motivation to continue is important and again the story  keeps you hooked. As a game it really pulls you in and the side game of  building a little town is nice. When you realise the work gone into the  game and the variety of play styles it supports (gamer, fitness, endurance,  etc) the money is totally worth it. One more addition, I had an issue with  a corrupt run log (as a result of my phone not the app) and the support  team were quick to respond, eager to assist and ensure everything was fixed  and that I was satisfied, it's the little things that let you know they  care that matter most sometimes.

Note that I said walking. I'm not a runner. But this said that walkers can use it. And I can, but I guess what I was expecting was more chases. something that made me feel like I was playing the game the whole time. What you really end up with is a little radio play that breaks into your music every once in awhile. it's interesting, but not as interactive as I expected it to be. I guess I was looking for more magic, LOL! But I like the way that it tracks you and I appreciate the unique vibe that it gives to a walk. I will say that the chases are definitely geared toward runners. I only have experienced two or three chases and have actually gone through six or seven chapters of this show. I thought there would be a couple of chases per walk. But I can NEVER outrun the zombies. I think they want me to start running, but I am not able to do that. So it is disappointing because even though I pick up my pace a lot, I always lose the chase. :( So they are not taking into consideration the speed that I have been walking prior to the chase, and that is disappointing. I also have found that I need to adjust the timing of each chapter to last about 20-30 minutes. Otherwise they don't break in as often as I like. I still recommend the app, but don't expect more than a little diversion during your run. Maybe the atmosphere will stay better if you set up a special playlist of eerie, ominous zombie music \u00f0\u009f\u00a4\u00a3 Because the music on my walking playlist kind of takes me out of the theme ;)   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""40"", ""review-text"": ""  Automatically play next doesn't work.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  Very useful app. I can also listen to what I'm saying in sleep which  interests me more. Audio quality is excellent compared to other apps. Paid  version is worth the cost to export files, to increase samples etc. It  would be great if in the future versions, paid members get cloud storage  for recordings.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""20"", ""review-text"": ""  This app will record OK. However the graphical data is now meaningless.  I'll explain.. The graph will show -' loud' snoring but when listening it  is actually heavier breathing. Then on the same graph loud snoring is  recorded at less volume. Making comparisons by day is therefore  meaningless. And I've actually spent money on this app.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  This app didn't take me long to get used to, and has given me surprising  insight into my nightly habits!

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""20"", ""review-text"": ""  Pretty sure for this app to be good, you have to pay for it... I hope,  because the free version is useless. The majority of things are locked  behind the pay wall, free version only records random samples throughout  the night (so you may or may not get the part you were apparently louder)  and the quality was absolutely terrible. Could not be more disappointed  with this app.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  This has been very helpful in tracking my snoring.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""20"", ""review-text"": ""  3 out of the 5 times I used this app, it didn't record any sound. I  downloaded it because my partner says I snore really loudly so I find it  hard to believe I didn't snore loudly enough to activate the recorder. The  times it did work I could hear myself turning over or getting up to go to  the bathroom not snoring.

Elegant and full of information. However can't  distinguish snoring from background noise. Would be even better if it  included as a feature a gentle, repeated, vibrating reminder to switch it  on each night before you sleep.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  Went from an average score of 50 to 60 down to an average of 0 to 5 just by  adding a fan to the room, tried a few different positions of the fan to  find the best one with the help of the app. I work in a firestation where  all the snorers sleep in a room called the swamp. Monitored the room before  and after adding fans and it's worked there too. The secret to stopping  snoring seems to be as simple as a fan.

The results were VERY different...one giving me a  snore score of 63 and the other of 21. Shed any light on this? Also I would  like to delete old recordings but can only seem to do this one at a time -  tedious!   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  Loved this app! I was able to discover within a week that propping myself  up on two pillows almost completely eliminated my snoring. I wake up  earlier now because I have slept better. Great investment!

Strava depends on GPS for recording activities. In some devices, the GPS does not work properly and Strava will not record effectively.

On these devices, we restrict installation of Strava, for example the Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 and the Galaxy Express 2.

com.urbandroid.lux.donate,Twilight Pro Unlock,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"100,000+",4.4,"Are you having trouble falling asleep? Are your kids hyperactive when playing with the tablet before bed time?
Are you using your smart phone or tablet in the late evening? Twilight may be a solution for you!
WARNING: Android O does no allow the app to cover your notifications and lockscreen anymore. We have some workarounds like wallpaper filtering etc..
Recent research suggests that exposure to blue light before sleep may distort your natural (circadian) rhythm and cause inability to fall asleep.
The cause is the photoreceptor in your eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range which may suppress Melatonin production - a hormone responsible for your healthy sleep-wake cycles.
In experimental scientific studies it has been shown an average person reading on a tablet or smart phone for a couple of hours before bed time may find their sleep delayed by about an hour.
The Twilight app makes your device screen adapt to the time of the day. It filters the blue spectrum on your phone or tablet after sunset and protects your eyes with a soft and pleasant red filter. The filter intensity is smoothly adjusted to the sun cycle based on your local sunset and sunrise times.
PRO features
- more than 2 predefined profiles
- adjustable transition time
- option to turn off Twilight service altogether during inactive times
- new features will often first appear as PRO
Thank you very much for your intention to support our development. This is a pro application for the Twilight app. Please install on top, do not uninstall Twilight first.

I reached out to customer service about a billing issue where my coach told me one thing and then they changed their minds about the process.

The only way to stop this is to either restart the phone, or go into apps and notifications and 'force stop' Relax Melodies. Then, it shows 0% usage. This is fairly recent (last two months or so), and even after the September 17 update this morning I still show it using a gigantic chunk of battery, even though it's not running.

A CALENDAR EXPLAINING THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR BABY: WHY YOUR BABY IS FUSSY, SLEEPS POOR AND EATS LESS DURING SET TIMES AND HOW YOU CAN HELP YOUR BABY.
================================================
THE BEST APP AROUND THE GLOBE
•	Awarded Coolest App for Moms
•	Awarded by Apple as top 10 ‘Best of the year 2016’ in Australia, UK, Netherlands, and a great number of other countries.
•	Consumer Choice & Gold Award by MumIi
•	AppRx Awards Top 10 Children’s Health App

================================================
The Wonder Weeks worldwide bestselling baby app is a personalised daily calendar of your baby’s development that will keep you informed about the (mental) leaps and bounds and the fussy phases of your baby -- any time of day or night. This baby calendar app won prizes in several countries as BEST PARENTING APP!
Think of it as a portable, at-a-glance version of the calendar leap chart in The Wonder Weeks. Where the book describes in-depth and easy-to-understand terms the incredible developmental changes your baby goes through, the app is the perfect leap calendar companion to track your baby’s mental development (during the first 20 months). By knowing what is going on inside the head of your baby, you can help him to make the leap more easily and stimulate his development.
The Wonder Weeks app helps new parents by:
- Calendar Showing when your baby makes a leap in his mental development
- What your baby can understand & learn after this mental leap
- What your baby can do after this leap
- What you can do to help your baby
This app is also a handy reminder for new parents when their baby’s brain is changing, or “leaping,” the baby is making a significant advance in mental development, and with each step forward comes a drastic change in the way your baby sees the world around him. Because these leaps come so quickly, the “new world” and new abilities can sometimes be scary, and the development can initially manifest in poor sleep, bad appetite, crying, clinging and crankiness – exhausting and frustrating mom and dad.
Disclaimer:   This App is developed with the greatest care. Neither the developer nor the author shall nevertheless be liable for any damages arising from any inaccuracies or omissions in this app.

Yoga at home can feel a little overwhelming if you're new to it  and mechanical if you're using an app that has the poses, but lacks the  compassion and loving kindness to support your practice. Adriene is good  about reminding you to be patient, be kind and love yourself. Much of her  content is free and on Youtube, but I gladly pay a monthly subscription fee  to bring her into my living room.

The platform is clean and easy to use and it is just really nice to access the content in a streamline way outside of YouTube. I wasn't sure it would make that much of a difference but it actually really adds to the experience and I get into my yoga session faster without being distracted. Also love the members only content. Especially the tapes of the live shows.   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  I love Adriene - she's the most amazing yoga teacher.
