What is Keto diet ?
The Keto Diet (known also as ketogenic diet or low carb diet ) is becoming more popular due in part to many people succeeding to lose weight relatively fast . It doesn’t really require a tracker or a counter : once you’ve been on keto diet for some time, you know to replace bread with lettuce or sugar with sweeteners. That replacement of high carbs meals with low carbs meals is one of the keys to succeed and lose weight .
Keto diet is also a great choice for people with diabetes . While other diets will require you count calories and points , some meal items will contain high amount of sugar . Keto diet helps you to eliminate this problem because a low carb meal plan also usually means low or no sugar meal plan .
Low carb diet is great for your weight loss. Low carb diet helps reduces risk for diabetes , high blood pressure and more. There is also a keto tracker and keto calculator to help count your carbs. We are hoping to add a keto calculator and a tracker to our app soon.One of the issues people on ketogenic diet face : eating out while on keto diet could be difficult.
