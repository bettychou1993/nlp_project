afh.calculator,Air Force PT Test Calculator,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"5,000+",4.3,"UPDATE: Version 2.0 supports Android Wear watches!
The simplest android-based way to calculate your score on the Air Force PT Test.  Based upon official Air Force guidance from AFI 36-2905, the Air Force PT Test Calculator provides Minimum and Maximum performance criteria (your max and min), and accurately calculates your PT Test score for any situation.  All PT Test exemptions are included.  PT Test altitude adjustments are fully supported.  Results for the 2-km walk test can be easily calculated as well.
Enter data using intuitive ""wheels"" rather than multiple pop-up dialogs.  The Android Wear module will load automatically to your watch and offers a fully functional, standalone method to calculate your score.  Now you can test without taking your phone, and still have full functionality right on your wrist.  We have worked hard to deliver a product that is simple, reliable, and accurate.  We believe it is the best available solution to calculate your Air Force PT Test score.",[]
agraetz.sunrisealarmp,Sunrise Alarm for LIFX & Hue,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"1,000+",4.4,"Don't you hate having to set a seperate alarm schedule for your LIFX & Philips Hue smart light?
Sunrise Alarm for LIFX & Hue
was made to fix this! The first automated sunrise alarm clock for LIFX & Philips Hue that has all the features you could ever ask for! Transform your LIFX & Hue lights into full-featured wake up lights!
How it works:
This app reads the next alarm set and turns on your LIFX & Hue lights
before
your alarm automatically, emulating a sunrise in your bedroom. It integrates with your regular alarm clock app!
Features:
• Adjustable colors: from red to the different shades of white (1500-6500k)
• Dynamic customizable color transition: light changes its color gradually e.g. from deep orange to daylight white
• Sunrise starting time before the alarm: 0 - 90 min
• Duration of the sunrise: 0 - 90 min
• Twilight: blue light before the sunrise
• Turns off the light afterwards automatically if desired
• Active hours: only act on alarms in a specified time frame
• Custom schedules
• Schedules can be exported to the bridge (Hue only)
• IFTTT support
• Tasker/Automate integration via intents
• Select single lights or groups/rooms
Please contact me, if the app doesn't work! I'll do my best to fix the issue but need your help in doing so. Every bug report helps me improving the app! I'll send you a refund, if we can't get it to work!
Be advised:
• Aggressive battery saving features of some devices/vendors may interfere with the functionality of
Sunrise Alarm
. Please keep them disabled or exclude
Sunrise Alarm
!
• There is currently a bug in the tool I use to create the app that causes it to crash on some devices. I am sorry if you're affected by this. Currently there is nothing I can do to fix this. Please request a refund via the store or contact me, if this is expired.
• Some wakeup apps don't set regular alarms that
Sunrise Alarm
can read. Automatic reading of the next alarm won't work with e.g. PocketBell.
Don't got any LIFX or Hue lights?
If you've got a smartlight that's supported by IFTTT,
Sunrise Alarm
can still provide basic functionality. In the debug menu there is the setting ""IFTTT / Tasker only mode"" and with this you can use
Sunrise Alarm
without having to setup or even own any LIFX or Hue lights!

This app is super user friendly, the Vita Flex charts are a wonderful reference to have at my fingertips & the search bar for anything under the 'Guide' section is fabulously useful.   I have shown this app to several other people who have decided to spend the $7-8 (whatever it costs, I forget since I've had it so long) on it because it's so much easier than flipping thru a super thick book to find the info that is just a few clicks away in this app.   I had chest pains from anxiety and almost went into the hospital because of it. I looked up heart/chest pains in the guide and found Ylang Ylang and Aroma Life as a suggestion to diffuse or breathe in directly from the bottle. I tried it and within minutes my chest pain was gone and I was calm and relaxed.  I tried this out on a few friends who were having anxiety attacks and crying from mental breakdowns and it had the same effect on them. Within a few minutes their eyes were clear and they were smiling again.  I have, without even trying to do so, made a few non-believers actually begin to believe in the power of essential oils and aroma therapy bc of the help listed in this app!  Absolutely recommend 100%! Especially if you use Young Living essential oils, as many of the blends are Young Living's own and you may not find them from other companies.

""The popular Couch to 5K app helps new runners avoid injury from doing too much, too soon.""
—Runners World, June 2012
""It's ridiculously easy to use (it's hard not to, as you just do what you're told) and it's fantastic that you have an encouraging voice talking you through things.""
—Engadget, June 2012
""Active.com’s Couch to 5K is one of my favorite… apps. With its customizable features, interactivity, and well-rounded interface, I may actually stay off the couch this time.""
—148Apps, October 2011
""I knew as soon as I decided to start the Couch to 5K program that I would need something to keep me accountable—not just to showing up for my training, but to actually doing it properly. Of course there’s an app for that.""
—CalorieLab, April 2012
""If you have been struggling to get your buns off the couch and somewhat in shape before the summer hits, training for a 5K is not a bad way to start. If you are looking for a program to help get you there, then the “Couch to 5K” running plan by CoolRunning is probably your best bet if you haven’t done an ounce of athletic activity for a number of years.""

What is blue light?
It's part of a natural light spectrum, which
disturbs the circadian rhythm
and causes sleeplessness. Unlike red light, bluelight blocks the secretion of melatonin, sleep hormone, after midnight and causes restlessness. Retinal neurons are in danger if night filter book light anti glare is not used after twilight.
The negative effects
of blue light flux are:
• Eye strain and tired eyes
• Higher risk of macular degeneration, glaucoma, and cataract
• Phase shifting of the circadian rhythm, restlessness, and suppression of melatonin
• Increased migraine pain and activation of the trigeminal nerve, associated with chronic migraines
• Frequent headaches and midnight chronic headache
• Insomnia and sleeplessness

by relieving eye strain and chronic headache during night reading. Its red light is best for eye protection from light blue rays that cause macular degeneration, glaucoma, melatonin deficiency, and insomnia. Macular degeneration and glaucoma are serious issues because macular degeneration is the leading cause of vision loss and glaucoma can cause blindness. Cataract often develops slowly, so start your tired eyes protection with bluelight filter by using it as a twilight book light as soon as possible!

+ Dimming below system minimum
- Use ""Dim"" night screen option to protect eyes from natural light blue rays. It's best for chronic headache relief during night reading because it gives a warmlight in form of a book light.
+ Temperature customization
- Use ""Temperature"" palette to set a warmlight (night mode) or cooler tint to your blue light filter. Red light colors are recommended as a bluelight flux filter for tired eyes and used as a midnight screen light or night shift for eye strain, chronic migraine relief, and restlessness.
+ Color customization
- Use ""Color"" palette to adjust the color tint, intensity and dim for your night screen. Night filter provides eye protection and migraine pain relief.
+ RGB customization
- Use ""RGB"" to fine-tune your natural light night reading filter. ""R"" - red light, ""G"" - green, ""B"" - light blue. Rest tired eyes with midnight book light and increase melatonin.
+ Automatic filter schedule
- Choose the times in which the anti glare night mode will shift on and off. Ensure that blue light filter is always turned on in the twilight or during the midnight hours to prevent cataract and fight insomnia and restlessness.
+ Reduce power usage
- Bluelight flux night shift reduces the night screen power usage. Use natural light filters to reduce power usage while relieving chronic headache and repairing circadian rhythm fixing your sleeplessness.","[{""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  So good I paid for it!

- Configurable test (choose test duration between 1, 3 or 5 minutes)
- Shows the PPG signal view to ensure signal quality during the test if the camera is used instead of a sensor
- Extracts and stores the following features while lying down and/or standing: heart rate, mean of beat-to-beat intervals (AVNN), standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals (SDNN), square root of the mean squared difference of successive R-Rs (rMSSD), number of pairs of successive R-Rs that differ by more than 50 ms (pNN50), low frequency power (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz), high frequency power (HF, 0.15-0.40 Hz)

After more than two years of testing and research with real moms and real babies, we came up with the following very valuable feature list.
Features:
•Safely stop baby from crying with rhythmic “shush” sound that engages a baby's natural calming reflex by reminding them of still being in the womb. So much more effective than simple lullabies or standard white noise.
•Shusher Timer Options (from 15 minutes to 8 hours of continuous shushing!)
•The amazing Sound Equalizer allows app to ""listen"" to your baby every three minutes and automatically adjusts the shush volume to baby’s cry volume (so when baby is wailing, shush is loud; when baby goes quiet, volume settles into a soothing background shush).

com.c13_1forpink2,Half Marathon Trainer 13.1 21K,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"10,000+",4.4,"From the same makers of the #1 C25K Trainer app, Half Marathon Trainer follows the same successful recipe to create an easy simple 13.1 (21k)  program, best suited for first-time half marathoners and those who are new to running. The program uses a blend of running and power walking in training and racing. You’ll soon be able to run-walk the entire half marathon.
See thousands of real success stories and race photos of your fellow runners using these running program at Facebook.com/c25kfree
=====================================================
★ This app will train you to complete a full 13.1 (26K) distance using a RUN/WALK strategy ★
=====================================================
This proven 14 week plan is designed for true beginner/novice runners who want to train for a half marathon, but have very little running experience. This run/walk program is perfect for newcomers, as the walk breaks help mentally break up the race into segments, so you can focus on one section at a time. These breaks help make the half/full marathon less grueling, as well as reduces the overall impact and risk of injury.
But don't think that just because walking is involved that your time will be slower, or that you're accomplishing less. Many veteran runners have posted personal best times after switching to this run walk method! By using a ratio of running and walking, you can manage your fatigue which gives you the muscle resource and mental confidence to handle the later parts of the race.
Slowly build strength and stamina, and the blend of walking and running together reduces the overall impact and risk of injury.  By the end of the program, you will be READY for your 13.1 (21k) race!
Listen to your favorite music while you train and follow the 13.1 program’s convenient audio alerts. Along with voice/audio alerts and music controls on your headset, just press “start”, put your device in your pocket, and you are ready to go. Alerts will tell you when to warm-up, walk, run, cooldown, and when minute is left to give it your all.

com.c26_2forpink2,Marathon Trainer - 26.2 42K,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"5,000+",4.3,"From the same makers of the #1 C25K Trainer app, Marathon Trainer follows the same successful recipe to create an easy simple 26.2 (42k)  program, best suited for first-time marathoners and those who are new to running. The program uses a blend of running and power walking in training and racing. You’ll soon be able to run-walk the entire marathon.
See thousands of real success stories and race photos of your fellow runners using these running program at Facebook.com/c25kfree
=============================================================
IMPORTANT: This app will train you to complete a full  26.2 (42k) distance using a RUN/WALK ratio
=============================================================
This proven 20 week plan is designed for true beginner/novice runners who want to train for a  marathon, but have very little running experience. This run/walk program is perfect for newcomers, as the walk breaks help mentally break up the race into segments, so you can focus on one section at a time. These breaks help make the marathon less grueling, as well as reduces the overall impact and risk of injury.
But don’t think that just because walking is involved that your time will be slower, or that you're accomplishing less. Many veteran runners have posted personal best times after switching to this run walk method! By using a ratio of running and walking, you can manage your fatigue which gives you the muscle resource and mental confidence to handle the later parts of the race.
Slowly build strength and stamina and the blend of walking and running together reduces the overall impact and risk of injury. By the end of the program, you will be READY for your  26.2 (42k)  race!
Listen to your favorite music while you train and follow the 26.2 program’s convenient audio alerts. Along with voice/audio alerts and music controls on your headset, just press “start”, put your device in your pocket, and you are ready to go. Alerts will tell you when to warm-up, walk, run, cooldown, and when minute is left to give it your all.

I may misunderstand how to use the app though but that's how it looks to me, even after I double check the date when I am inputting the data.  2. I realise you explain the colour coding system on the play website. But it would be great for new users to have that in the app when they first use it.  3. There should also be a way of deleting input which may be mistakes, tests or simply inaccurate. For example, I often put test data into an app to see if it works and does what it says and I like/understand the input/output(graphs, charts - whatever). However, I cannot delete  my test entry I made after I installed the app so now all subsequent readings are influenced by that fictitious test cup of coffee.

How about giving a length of time that a drink took to drink? How about personal profiles for more than 1 drinker? Do all brands of coffee have the same caffeine level?

How it Works
An intelligent 3D motion recognition algorithm is embedded to track only walking patterns by filtering and ejecting out non-walking activities. Accupedo counts your steps regardless of where you put your phone like your pocket, waist belt, or bag. Easily track your progress through the use of this sophisticated algorithm and walk towards a healthier you!
Attention
Your phone may not compatible with Accupedo. Some phones do not support the G-sensor in sleep (Standby, when screen is OFF) mode by those phone manufacturers. This is not a defect of this app.
Notes
• Step count may not be accurate if you put your phone in loose fit pants due to the random movement your phone makes in the pocket.
• The sensitivity of a phone can be different from others. So, choose a sensitivity level that works best for your phone.
• Help and FAQ are built in the app.","[{""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  Great app   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  Great   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""60"", ""review-text"": ""  I liked the old graphics better.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  For years with calorie count diets, my husband has complained to me about  how little his portions were, and how 'You won't let me eat anything', as  if I were the food police. I insisted that WE BOTH buy this app on our  phones, so it goes everywhere with us. We learned a points diet that allows  you freedom to eat. He aquates his points to money, and I hear him say, ' I  can't afford that'. Finally, I can retire my food police hat, and relax. We  have been on this app for a week and a half, and I am down in weight by  8.2lbs with daily exercise, and he is down 5lbs without exercise...I guess  that will be our next hurdle.

The only negative thing I can say about  the app is that you can only use whole or half portions so there's no way  to do a 1/4 cup or 3/4 of a cup etc..... other than that this app has been  a godsend.

What Our Customers Have Said
“MyFLO is worlds better! I quit using other apps because they didn't offer much more than complicated graphs.”
“MyFLO is such a great resource. Other apps I've tried make it hard to sync your actual cycle with their general cycle.”
“MyFLO blows my other tracker out of the water. I love that I can track my symptoms and the app will notice patterns AND give me advice and assistance!!”
“My FAVORITE PART is the cycle email tips to my significant other. I LOVE it and my boyfriend LOVES it too. The weekly tips for loving me better make him feel like he can win with me, and that's amazing. I recommend this app for this reason alone.”
Note: MyFLO does not prevent conception, and it should not be used to prevent unwanted pregnancy. My FLO can track your period and predict your fertile window, but many factors can affect the exact date of ovulation.","[{""rating"": ""60"", ""review-text"": ""  It is telling me im 27 days late on my period when i already put 'my period started' and now it wont show me months past august and when i go to fix my last period date it wont let me it just starts glitching.

Gives decent information, I like that it has a way to track individual data points/symptoms throughout your cycle. Lately, notifications have been incessant.

I also got a new phone, there is no way to transfer/export the data I've been tracking for over a year.(UPDATE: I had to uninstall and reinstall on the new phone and it seemed to retrieve the data correctly, but that there is NO information in the FAQ about this - sad oversight). Tried to send an email through the app, won't send. Also, somehow my email in the system is wrong (um, why isn't it using the gmail from the Google Play account it was purchased from....), and there is no way to update it (no 'Update profile here').

I like the app to a certain degree,  though it is certainly automated.  At a certain point it can no longer customize to you.   ---((previous) Have only been using for a few weeks, but I keep getting requests to review...so here I am. I think the information provided is great, but once you have said when your cycle has happened, you are sort of 'locked in' for awhile to what they will be telling you. I think there is a way to adjust that later.

The other miss , the most annoying one ,  is that in the same fix it tells me that my estrogen is too high and too  low : so I need both increase it and decrease it at the same time :( Also  it does not list my symptoms of the day when I try to track them ( I guess  because it is not relevant at the particular phase? ) and does not let me  save data unless I tick 'no symptoms.' At least call it 'no relevant  symptoms ' if headache or bloating not relevant in particular phases. It  also constantly pushes to buy additional products that are very expensive  (250 to 400 dollars). I wander how is my free app can send me analysis of  my period and all other good reminders without pushing any in app  purchasing.

Is your child sick? Whether you're on the go or at home, this app will help you know what to do next.
What should you do if your child develops a fever, cough, vomiting, rash, sore throat or head injury? When can your child return to school or child care after an illness? These are medical advice questions that all parents have. Health problems can arise anytime – evenings, weekends, when you’re at work or traveling or your doctor’s office is closed.
KidsDoc is designed especially for these times. The care guides help you make smart decisions on what level of care (if any) is needed and how to provide speedy symptom relief for minor illnesses or injuries you can manage on your own.
KidsDoc is derived from the clinical protocols used by pediatricians and nurses in 10,000 practices and 400 nurse advice call centers in the US and Canada. They have been tested for 16 years on more than 150 million symptom calls.
Features
Easy 3-step navigation:
1. Choose the most appropriate symptom care guide
2. Use the symptom decision chart to find the recommended action
3. Follow the self care advice to make your child more comfortable
The care guide that best matches your child’s symptom can be located quickly by using the alphabetical index, body area index, or keyword search.
Content - each symptom care guide contains:
* Definition which describes the focus of the care guide so you can decide if it’s a good fit for your child's problem. If not, there are quick links to related care guides.
* Decision Chart which helps determine what action is suggested based on the severity and description of your child's symptom. Once you have a match, simply follow the corresponding action, such as Call 911, Call Your Child’s Doctor Now, Call Your Child’s Doctor within 24 hours or Manage at Home.
* Immediate Connections to medical help, such as 911, your child’s doctor or nearby Emergency Department (ER) are available if you have phone service.
* Home Care Advice is available for any illnesses and injuries that can be safely treated at home. The instructions provide clear, up-to-date steps for relieving symptoms.
Extras:
* Medication and Allergy List for tracking important information about your family’s prescriptions and/or over the counter medications.
* Pediatric dosage tables for common over-the-counter medications.
* Visual images to help you identify symptoms (e.g. rashes), injuries and common causes of bites & stings.
* First Aid topics and illustrations to support immediate action, if needed.

com.hansler.android.symmetricstrength,Symmetric Strength,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"1,000+",4.8,"If you train the squat, bench press, deadlift, or other major compound lifts, then Symmetric Strength is for you. Symmetric Strength provides a comprehensive lifter analysis based on strength research and data from strength competitions.
This is the Android version of the website. If you're unsure if the app is for you, check out the website version for free at https://symmetricstrength.com/.
Key features:
* Get a detailed breakdown of your current strength level, your strong points and weak points, and how proportionate your lifts are with each other.
* View a color-coded figure, showing you how strong each of your muscle groups are.
* All analyses are adjusted for sex, age, and bodyweight, so it is suitable for both men and women, as well as younger and older lifters. This allows, for example, an 110 pound woman to compare her strength score to her 200 pound male friend's score.
* Use either the Metric or Imperial systems.
* Compare your strength with others! Each of your lifts and muscle groups are given ""strength scores"", which range from subpar and untrained all the way to world class, which would place you alongside international strength athletes.
* Add friends who also use Symmetric Strength (either the app or the website), so you can keep each other accountable and compare progress.
* View a detailed progress chart as you continue logging your lifts, showing how you have improved over time.
* Estimate your one-rep maxes in any lift with the included one-rep max calculator.
* See how you would fare in a powerlifting competition with the included Wilks calculator.
* Learn how many calories you burn per day with the included TDEE calculator.
* Figure out your ideal body weight for different sports, from bodybuilding, to mixed martial arts, to marathon running!
* See how you stack up to others by referencing the included strength standards, which, like all of Symmetric Strength, is backed by research and competition data.
* Use the app in ""offline mode"" when you don't have internet access.
How does Symmetric Strength work? Simply enter your stats (sex, weight, and age) along with which lifts you train at the gym, and your most difficult recent sets with each lift. Symmetric Strength then crunches that data, using strength research and lifting competition data, to provide you the most accurate analysis possible regarding your strength. The possible lifts you can enter are the following:
* Back Squat
* Front Squat
* Deadlift
* Sumo Deadlift
* Power Clean
* Bench Press
* Incline Bench Press
* Dip
* Overhead Press
* Push Press
* Snatch Press
* Chin-up
* Pull-up
* Pendlay Row

• Download the FREE intro guide ""Quickstart Guide to Forecasting a Woman's Moods, Libido & Energy"" at
FemaleForecaster.com
• Created by Gabrielle Lichterman, founder of
Hormonology
, author of
28 Days: What Your Cycle Reveals about Your Love Life, Moods and Potential
and longtime women's health journalist
• Inspired by girlfriends and wives who use Gabrielle's popular
Hormone Horoscope App
--and asked her to create a simpler, more condensed version for their male partners
TAKE THE GUESSWORK OUT OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP
Get confused by the changing moods of your girlfriend or wife? Wonder why her desire for physical intimacy is high one day, then bottomed-out the next?
There will be no more guessing when you use the
Female Forecaster App
.
This new app for boyfriends and husbands lets you know what her moods, libido, energy level and more will be every day.
And, it all comes down to where she is in her monthly cycle.
THE SCIENCE
As three key hormones (estrogen, testosterone and progesterone) rise and fall throughout a woman's monthly cycle, research shows they impact her brain and body in a wide variety of ways.
Because her hormones repeat the same up and down pattern every cycle, the effects her hormones have on her also repeat the same way cycle after cycle--making her moods, libido, energy and more easy to predict.
For example...
• On Day 7 of a woman's hormone cycle, she's happier, energetic and experiencing a spike in her sex drive thanks to rising estrogen--making this a day when boyfriends and husbands can do no wrong.
• On Day 19, she's quieter, sluggish and her desire for physical intimacy is low due to sedating progesterone, which is a hormone that reins in sexual desire--so men shouldn't take her ""Not tonight, dear"" personally.
• On Day 27, a drop in estrogen can make her irritable and blue, but she also experiences a rise in libido--which explains why she can be cross with you one minute, but want to cuddle with you the next.

HOW TO USE THE APP
Setting it up takes seconds: Simply input two pieces of information about your girlfriend or wife to launch the app's cycle calendar:
• The typical length of her menstrual cycle (input 28 days if you don't know)
• The day she's on in her cycle right now (just ask her--her Day 1 is the first day of her most recent period and she just counts from there)
You can then read your
Female Forecast
for today or look at any point in the future--tomorrow, next week, next month, even next year--to find out what she'll be like then.
APP BONUSES
This app also allows you to...
• Get alerts about key days in her cycle (for instance, when her premenstrual week is arriving)
• Create custom alerts
• Keep notes
• Get date ideas and tips for getting on her good side
WHO THIS APP IS FOR
Male partners of women who have
• Healthy menstrual cycles
• Menstrual cycles lasting anywhere from 22 to 49 days (it's okay if her cycle length varies from month to month)
• Natural hormones (no hormone birth control)
This app is not intended for partners of women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, menopausal, taking hormone medications or hormone birth control or have a health disorder that impacts hormones, such as PCOS.
This app is not intended to help users and their partners avoid pregnancy or become pregnant.

WHAT IS PALEO?
Although its often called a “diet,” paleo is simply a different way of looking at how you eat food. Paleo is actually quite simple:
Eat These Foods:
-Vegetables
-Meats
-Fruits
-Nuts
-Seeds
Don’t Eat These Foods:
-Processed Food
-Sugar
-Grains
-Dairy
-Legumes
The paleo diet is focused on eating food that has been around since the Paleolithic era. That's why the paleo diet is also known as the caveman diet. Its focused on eating nutrient-dense, whole, unprocessed foods that are easy for your body to digest.
------------------------------------------
Put the power of paleo in your pocket, and stay paleo out there!

Find happiness by contemplating your mortality with the WeCroak app. Each day, we’ll send you five invitations at randomized times to stop and think about death. It’s based on a Bhutanese folk saying that to be a happy person one must contemplate death five times daily.
The WeCroak invitations come at random times and at any moment just like death. When they come, you can open the app for a quote about death from a poet, philosopher, or notable thinker.
You are encouraged to take one moment for contemplation, conscious breathing or meditation when WeCroak notifications arrive. We find that a regular practice of contemplating mortality helps spur needed change, accept what we must, let go of things that don’t matter and honor things that do.
We’ve also added features to make WeCroak work with your modern life.
•	WeCroak only sends notification between 7 AM and 10 PM
•	Open the app once per week to keep receiving your five daily WeCroak invitations at randomized times

No nasty hidden fees half way in. I love the lay out and design of the app too, simple and beautiful.  A lot of people say some of the voices are too abrasive or not pleasant enough for meditation. In part I agree but you get used to them. And if you don't and there's only one persons voice you enjoy, you can search by that persons voice to only do meditations with them.  One con however that I've noticed a lot through other reviews is the inability to line up meditations in a sort of playlist and the fact that there is no indication of a session ending which can get disruptive when you're checking all the time if this is the end or a space for thought.

For one, it can become difficult to navigate when adding an item that contains an item that contains an item etc... As silly as it may sound, the (sometimes long) process of looking up and inserting ingredients can make me forget which item I am currently working on. It would thus be much appreciated if there was a way to understand exactly which page you are on at all times. Secondly, it can be quite frustrating to lose some carefully inputted data when you accidentally click on the 'Return' button while adding a number of ingredients to your new item (think muesli).

Look ahead to future cycles and plan your sacred ritual, either in stillness or with your tribe! Set up alerts to know when the next phases are coming, so that you can make time to tune in.
Reflect and capture.
After you engage in sacred rituals, capture your response in a simple journal built right into the app. It’s just for you and your journey.

com.myniotech.brainwavespro,Brain Waves Pro Binaural Beats,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"1,000+",4.4,"With this app you can easily generate pure waves that will stimulate your concentration, meditation or relaxation.
You can generate and save your own frequencies using two independent oscillators, controlled by two horizontal bars or the buttons ""Set L and Set R"", which allow you to enter the exact amount you want.
Use values with two decimal points (eg 125.65), or choose one of the built in presets.
The sounds are produced in real time, they are not pre-recorded sounds. This enables to play them without interruption.
The pure sine-wave sounds are processed in real time natively by your mobile device with Pure Data (libpd).
===========
How it works
===========
Binaural beats, or binaural tones, are auditory processing artifacts, or apparent sounds, caused by specific physical stimuli.
This effect was discovered in 1839 by Heinrich Wilhelm Dove and earned greater public awareness in the late 20th century based on claims coming from the alternative medicine community that binaural beats could help induce relaxation, meditation, creativity and other desirable mental states.
The effect on the brainwaves depends on the difference in frequencies of each tone: for example, if 300 Hz was played in one ear and 310 in the other, then the binaural beat would have a frequency of 10 Hz.
To experience the binaural beats perception, it is best to listen to this file with headphones on moderate to weak volume – the sound should be easily heard, but not loud. Note that the sound appears to pulsate only when heard through both earphones.
For more info visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beats
Important
For best results please use headphones.
Take care of your hearing, is not necessary to hear these sounds at high volume.
The vertical bar controls the volume, but it is independent of your device's volume, so if there is no sound or it's too high, also set your device's volume to balance the sound.
Manage Presets
You can save a preset directly from the main screen by clicking on the button ""save"" , the current values are loaded automatically to the next screen.
Then just type a name and click Save.
To load a preset, click on Presets in the main screen and then choose a preset by clicking on its name.
To delete a preset simply click on the trashcan button.
Running in background
To let the app running in the background, just press the ""Home"" button on your device.
If you press the \""Back\"" button the app will close.
Timer
Just type a value in minutes. The app will shutdown automatically when the time ends.

It does this by combining guided instructions and focused attention with bilateral brain stimulation. Bilateral stimulation is a treatment element of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing), a revolutionary treatment which is based on the use of sensory stimulation to alter anxiety-provoking memories and responses. Over 30 randomized controlled studies of EMDR attest to the efficacy of this process.  The author also has two research studies in submission with peer-reviewed scientific journals based on this process.
Because bilateral stimulation appeals to the unconscious, sensing part of the brain, there is no need for effortful thinking or struggling with feelings. All you have to do is LISTEN and your brain will do the rest! The App consists of;
1 x brain training session
2 x guided anxiety management sessions
1 x pure bilateral stimulation session (audio & visual)
1 x safe place exercise
Progress Log function with prompts
Powerful Bls brain visual simulating brain activity associated with anxiety reduction

Disclaimer: Period Tracker period and fertility forecasts may not be accurate and should not be used to prevent unwanted pregnancy.  To forecast ovulation Period Tracker calculates 14 days before the projected start date of one's next period.  Forecast accuracy depends on a number of factors including how regular one's cycle length is, when one actually ovulates during the cycle, and how many periods have been logged in the app.  Anxiety, stress, diet, nutrition, exercise, environment, medications, age and other factors can also affect one's cycle from month to month.

WARNING: This is not a medical product.
If knowing your pulse rate is critical to your health, you need to have your pulse taken by a medical professional. Heart Rate Monitor is not intended to diagnose, prevent or treat any condition, or to be a substitute for professional medical care.  Measurements and statistics are intended for informational and educational purposes only, to support general health and wellness.

EASY TO USE
* Place and lightly hold your (index) finger against the back camera lens and flashlight
* Do not press too hard, otherwise blood circulation will be altered and the results could be
affected
* When using a smartphone or tablet without a LED flashlight, be sure to take the measurement in a well-lit area (bright daylight works best)
* Remain calm and try not to move too much during the measurement, as this can compromise measurement accuracy
* Do not measure with cold fingers when the blood circulation is poor

The book lists edamame for a snack, but the app doesn't have that listed under snacks.  I look at this way of eating as kind of a magic spell, or a prescription to wellness, so if there are contradictions or omitted things I don't know if it's a mistake, or if the magic needs the omission or contradiction to work.

In addition to the errors, some other complaints worth noting: * You cannot select more than one protein, fat, grain or fruit (but you can select multiple vegetables) in a single meal. So if you eat a half portion of avocado, for example, drizzled with a half portion of olive oil as your healthy fat, you're out of luck in terms of tracking. * Veggie portions are described as unlimited, but the app doesn't indicate that  2 cups of veggies of veggies is the minimum serving size if you're losing under 20 lbs and 3 cups is the minimum if you need to lose more than 20 pounds. * Portion sizes for some items are wrong.

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""80"", ""review-text"": ""  Good app for tracking progress in 531 exercises. I really like the way it  encourages you to set PRs every session with target reps. 2 main criticisms  (feedback points really) are:- 1. Allow the user to make additional custom  templates with additional workout days and exercises that are included in  the latter books and to make their own work outs based on ppl or something.  2. Having different ways to progress assistance exercises rather than just  sets and reps i.e. using rest pause and total volume. So for example if my  goal today was to do 50 total reps of chin ups then having counter that let  me hit 50 with out having to add additional sets would be better (like the  zero to hero app does).

Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  This is a really useful app for the basic novice program and even allows you to add chinups as progression advances. This app would be even better if it had the option of adding mid-week back-off for the advanced novice program. As it sits, the mid week set for squats just needs to be modified or added later and calculated by hand, which is not difficult. This is about as useful of an app as I can think of for a lifting program.

After reading the books, and lifting weights for years using other programs, I made the switch to Starting Strength about a month ago, and I absolutely love it.

com.syncmytracks,SyncMyTracks,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"10,000+",4.2,"Would you like to change your sport tracking application and keep your activities? Or maybe you use 2 or more of these services and would you like to have them synchronized? Now you can do all this with SyncMyTracks!
- What is SyncMyTracks?
It's an Android app used to sync your activities of the most popular sports tracking services. You can see the list of supported services by SyncMyTracks here: http://syncmytracks.com/#compatibility
- How does export & import work?
Simply entering data (email and password) of both accounts, the activities are exported from one account to the others, using GPX or TCX files.
- How does account sync work?
Simply add the accounts you want to sync, and SyncMyTracks will do the synchronization. If you make a new activity with any of your accounts, it automatically syncs to the others accounts. In application settings you can set the time interval wherein SyncMyTracks check for new activities, or you can disable automatic synchronization.
- Which activities are synchronized?
When you synchronize a new account you can choose to synchronize all activities (activities that have already been done in the past and new activities you will do in the future) or just the new ones.
- What data is synchronized?
SyncMyTracks synchronizes activity path information, such as time, duration, distance, pace and map. Also the heart rate, cadence, power and temperature are synchronized, when they are supported by different services.
- Can SyncMyTracks delete or modify my activities in synchronization?
Never! SyncMyTracks just adds activities to your accounts, it doesn't delete or modify the activities that you already have.
- Can SyncMyTracks duplicate my activities in synchronization?
SyncMyTracks prevents duplication of activities considering the start time of the activity.
- Where are emails and passwords of my accounts saved?
SyncMyTracks stores this data on your mobile. Passwords are stored using encryption. This data is only used to connect the accounts.
- What are the differences between the free version and the paid version?
In the free version, account sync is unavailable. Only you can export and import your activities. In addition, in the free version you can only export the last 40 activities at most. The paid version contains no ads.
- Can you use the export and import and synchronization with the same accounts?
Not recommended, it could create duplicate activities already synchronized.
- Can you use Facebook or Google+ to login and sync my accounts?
No. You must use your email and password. If password is not set, you must generate it in your account settings.
- Is SyncMyTracks sponsored, maintained or supported it by tracking services supported?
No, SyncMyTracks is independent of them. Therefore, be sure to use the application on the terms and conditions detailed on their respective web sites.

com.urbandroid.lux.donate,Twilight Pro Unlock,HEALTH_AND_FITNESS,"100,000+",4.4,"Are you having trouble falling asleep? Are your kids hyperactive when playing with the tablet before bed time?
Are you using your smart phone or tablet in the late evening? Twilight may be a solution for you!
WARNING: Android O does no allow the app to cover your notifications and lockscreen anymore. We have some workarounds like wallpaper filtering etc..
Recent research suggests that exposure to blue light before sleep may distort your natural (circadian) rhythm and cause inability to fall asleep.
The cause is the photoreceptor in your eyes, called Melanopsin. This receptor is sensitive to a narrow band of blue light in the 460-480nm range which may suppress Melatonin production - a hormone responsible for your healthy sleep-wake cycles.
In experimental scientific studies it has been shown an average person reading on a tablet or smart phone for a couple of hours before bed time may find their sleep delayed by about an hour.
The Twilight app makes your device screen adapt to the time of the day. It filters the blue spectrum on your phone or tablet after sunset and protects your eyes with a soft and pleasant red filter. The filter intensity is smoothly adjusted to the sun cycle based on your local sunset and sunrise times.
PRO features
- more than 2 predefined profiles
- adjustable transition time
- option to turn off Twilight service altogether during inactive times
- new features will often first appear as PRO
Thank you very much for your intention to support our development. This is a pro application for the Twilight app. Please install on top, do not uninstall Twilight first.

We can actually configure vibration times in 'custom vibration' option, but not in 'vibration and text' one.  We can not only send text without vibration (idk if it's possible).

When you have a lot of applications added for notifications editing them becomes very slow. Also, there is no option to load custom watchfaces or firmware like in other apps.

step count Bubble will turn blue
when you've been sitting too long
►Access the sitting alert settings from your phone's Bubble Cloud app!

--- HINTS & TIPS ---
ACTIVITY CHART
Shows your steps in the last 8 x 15 minutes (2 hours). Watches may differ in step detection. You will see what your particular watch detects. Note: the activity chart will only appear after 15-30 minutes following installation (and only if there was at least one step detected).
SET AND FORGET
In day to day practice this is a fully automatic app. You set the active hours of the day, reminder frequency and the limit based on your watch, then it will politely do its thing. No more fiddling necessary.
NEVER DISTURBS
It will not frustrate you with unwanted, repeated alerts: if you are not in a situation when you can get up, just keep the notification. It will go away automatically as soon as you get to get up. No repeat alerts.
FALSE STEP DETECTS
Our watches do a good job of differentiating steps from other movements, but there will always be mistakes. Experience:
►Moto 360 (1st gen) 20-30 false detects / hour
►Huawei Watch 60-80 / hour
INITIAL SETUP
Enable ""Inactivity tracking"", and do your sitting work for an hour or so. The activity chart will show you how many steps were - falsely - detected when you just worked at your desk. Set movement goal slightly higher than the number of false detected steps in the sample hour.
IN PRACTICE
If you don't get up for a period of time, the watch will remind you: Do not dismiss the notification if you are not in a situation when you can stand up. It will not alert you until you do get to get up",[]

A CALENDAR EXPLAINING THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOUR BABY: WHY YOUR BABY IS FUSSY, SLEEPS POOR AND EATS LESS DURING SET TIMES AND HOW YOU CAN HELP YOUR BABY.
================================================
THE BEST APP AROUND THE GLOBE
•	Awarded Coolest App for Moms
•	Awarded by Apple as top 10 ‘Best of the year 2016’ in Australia, UK, Netherlands, and a great number of other countries.
•	Consumer Choice & Gold Award by MumIi

================================================
The Wonder Weeks worldwide bestselling baby app is a personalised daily calendar of your baby’s development that will keep you informed about the (mental) leaps and bounds and the fussy phases of your baby -- any time of day or night. This baby calendar app won prizes in several countries as BEST PARENTING APP!
Think of it as a portable, at-a-glance version of the calendar leap chart in The Wonder Weeks. Where the book describes in-depth and easy-to-understand terms the incredible developmental changes your baby goes through, the app is the perfect leap calendar companion to track your baby’s mental development (during the first 20 months). By knowing what is going on inside the head of your baby, you can help him to make the leap more easily and stimulate his development.
The Wonder Weeks app helps new parents by:
- Calendar Showing when your baby makes a leap in his mental development
- What your baby can understand & learn after this mental leap
- What your baby can do after this leap
- What you can do to help your baby
This app is also a handy reminder for new parents when their baby’s brain is changing, or “leaping,” the baby is making a significant advance in mental development, and with each step forward comes a drastic change in the way your baby sees the world around him. Because these leaps come so quickly, the “new world” and new abilities can sometimes be scary, and the development can initially manifest in poor sleep, bad appetite, crying, clinging and crankiness – exhausting and frustrating mom and dad.
Disclaimer:   This App is developed with the greatest care. Neither the developer nor the author shall nevertheless be liable for any damages arising from any inaccuracies or omissions in this app.

-	Learn everything about the mental development of your baby HANDS-FREE!
-	Great for MULTI-TASKING
-	Contains all INFORMATION from the famous WonderWeeks book
(Slight differences with the printed book for recording purposes)
Audiobook of—The worldwide bestseller and multiple award winning—The Wonder Weeks. How to stimulate your baby's mental development and help him turn his 10 predictable, great, fussy phases into magical leaps forward describes the incredible mental developmental changes (leaps) and regression periods that all babies go through. Understanding the real reason behind crying, eating and sleeping problems is the only real solution every parent needs. The Wonder Weeks reveals what’s going on inside baby’s mind.
The audio-book includes:
•	Week-by-week guide to baby's behavior
•	When to expect the fussy behavior, what this implies (cranky, clingy, crying (the three C's) behavior) and how to deal with these regression periods (leaps)
•	A description from your baby's perspective of the world around him and how you can understand the changes he's going through
•	Fun games and gentle activities you can do with your child
The audio book is based on the scientific- and parental-world-changing discovery of a phenomenon: all normal, healthy babies appear to be more fussy at very nearly the same ages, regression periods, and sleep less in these phases.
These age-related fluctuations in need for body contact and attention (regression periods) are related to major and quite dramatic changes in the brains of the children. These changes enable a baby to enter a whole new perceptual world and, as a consequence, to learn many new skills. This should be a reason for celebration, but as far as the baby is concerned these changes are bewildering. He's taken aback—everything has changed overnight. It is as if he has woken up on a strange planet. He needs you to guide him and understand what he is going through! Get ready to rediscover the world all over again with your baby…",[]

Cheers   Full Review   ""}, {""rating"": ""100"", ""review-text"": ""  It would be no over statement to say that this has changed my life. I found the first session the most helpful: there are little 'hooks' that caught something in my mind and which have stayed with me.  I am far happier, calmer, and, thank goodness, slimmer. The female therapist has a lovely soothing English voice, which is neither  irritating or grating.  I  have to say I am not so keen on the male voice, but I seldom listen to him. The music is very nice indeed, and I would quite like a recording of just that. Very soothing.  If you really want to lose weight this is the best \u00c2\u00a34.99 you could ever spend.

I've done every diet under the sun, losing weight, gaining weight, feeling deprived of things I enjoy. This is different, something just clicks, you start making healthier choices, your portions gradually get smaller but you can still eat the things you enjoy you just naturally eat less of them. 24lb loss and still going, give it a go you won't regret it.
